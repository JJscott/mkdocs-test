<h3 id="cr1.0.2">1.0.2 A restriction is a rule or effect that states something cannot happen. A requirement is a rule or effect that states that something should happen if possible. An allowance is a rule or effect that states something can happen. A restriction takes precedence over any requirement or allowance, and a requirement takes precedence over any allowance, subject to <sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.0.1a">[1.0.1a]</a></sup>.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr1.0.2" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> "They can't defend this with equipment" is a restriction, "They must defend this with equipment they control if able" is a requirement, and "They may defend this with equipment they control" is an allowance.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If one effect reads "You can't play cards from your banished zone," and another effect reads "You may play cards from your banished zone," the restriction takes precedence over the allowance and the player cannot play cards from their banished zone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Three of a Kind has the text "[...] you may only play cards from arsenal," which is a restriction equivalent to "you cannot play cards from anywhere other than arsenal." Even if an effect would allow you to play a card from your banished zone (an allowance), or require you to play your next card from hand (a requirement) you would not be able to play that card because of the restriction effect generated by Three of a Kind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Overpower is an ability with an effect that prevents its source from being defended by more than 1 action card (a restriction).

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Dorinthea, Quicksilver Prodigy has the text "The first time Dawnblade, Resplendent gets go again each turn, [...]," which identifies an object using the name "Dawnblade, Resplendent" as an object identity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Endless Arrow has the text "When Endless Arrow hits, put it into your hand." If Endless Arrow hits, it is put into the player's hand.

<h4 id="cr1.2.3c">1.2.3c Last known information about an object is immutable - it cannot be altered. Rules and effects that would modify the object that no longer exists do not modify the last known information about an object; this may cause effects to fail.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr1.2.3c" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Luminaris has the text "If there is a yellow card in your pitch zone, your Illusionist attacks get go again." If you controlled an Illusionist attack as a chain link on the combat chain, but it was removed, and then you put a yellow card in your pitch zone to meet Luminaris's condition, the chain link does not have go again because the last known information about the attack cannot be altered.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cr1.2.3d">1.2.3d Last known information about an object is not an object itself - it is not a legal target for rules and effects.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr1.2.3d" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h3 id="cr1.2.4">1.2.4 Card and macro objects are the source of abilities, effects, non-card layers, and attack-proxies.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr1.2.4" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Oasis Respite has the text "Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to target hero this turn by a source of your choice."

<h3 id="cr1.9.1">1.9.1 An event is a change in the game state produced by the resolution of a layer, the result of an effect, a transition of turn phase or combat step, or an action taken by a player. An event may involve physically changing the game state through one or more instructions - it can be modified by replacement effects<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/06-effects/#cr6.4">[6.4]</a></sup> and can trigger triggered effects<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/06-effects/#cr6.6">[6.6]</a></sup>.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr1.9.1" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Go Bananas has the text "Open and reveal a booster pack of Flesh and Blood and put all cards with the chosen name into your hand," which creates a 'reveal' event and a 'put' event as part of its resolution. The 'reveal' event only operates outside of the game, so any replacement effects and triggered effects within the game do not interact with it.  The 'put' event directly interacts with the game by putting an object into a game zone, so replacement effects and triggered effects within the game may interact with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cr1.9.1b">1.9.1b If an event comprises an instruction to do nothing, the event does not occur. It cannot be modified by replacement effects and does not trigger effects.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr1.9.1b" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Blazing Aether has the text "Deal X arcane damage to target hero, where X is the amount of arcane damage you have dealt to that hero this turn." If the player has dealt 0 arcane damage this turn, the resolution of Blazing Aether produces an event that deals 0 arcane damage. Because dealing 0 arcane damage is an instruction to do nothing, it simply does not occur. It cannot be modified to deal more arcane damage by replacement effects, and it does not trigger effects for dealing arcane damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cr1.9.1c">1.9.1c If an event comprises an instruction where failure cannot be verified by an opponent based on the current game state, that player may choose to fail to complete that instruction. If they do, the event simply fails as if that instruction cannot be completed.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr1.9.1c" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Moon Wish has the text "When this hits, search your deck for a card named Sun Kiss, [...]." The opponent cannot verify that a Sun Kiss is in the player's because the deck is private to the player, so the player may choose to fail to find a card named Sun Kiss even if there is one in their deck.</p>

<h3 id="cr1.9.2">1.9.2 A compound event is an event that involves performing the same instructions more than once. An effect that produces a compound event is typically written in a compact format, where the effect specifies to repeat an instruction a number of times. When a compound event occurs, it is expanded, and the instructions occur as individual events.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr1.9.2" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Tome of Harvests has the text "Draw 3 cards," which is an effect written in compact form, that produces a compound event that involves drawing a card three times. Each draw is performed as an individual event: draw a card, draw a card, draw a card.</p>
