<h4 id="cr7.0.1a">7.0.1a During combat, while the combat chain is open, a player cannot play cards or activate activated abilities with the type action, except for attacks during the Resolution Step of combat<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/07-combat/#cr7.6">[7.6]</a></sup>.

<h3 id="cr7.0.2">7.0.2 The combat chain is a zone<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/03-zones/#cr3.6">[3.6]</a></sup> that is open during combat and closed otherwise.

<h4 id="cr7.0.2a">7.0.2a The combat chain starts the game closed. If the combat chain is closed and an attack is added to the stack, the combat chain opens and the Layer Step begins immediately. The combat chain remains open until it is closed again<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/07-combat/#cr7.7.2">[7.7.2]</a></sup>.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.0.2a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr7.0.2b">7.0.2b When referring to combat chain as a time, the combat chain starts when it opens and ends when closes. If an effect states "this combat chain" it refers to the current combat chain if it is open - if the combat chain is closed the effect fails to be generated.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.0.2b" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h3 id="cr7.0.3">7.0.3 A chain link is an element of the combat chain and represents the resolution of an attack. A chain link is neither an object nor a zone. A chain link comprises an active-attack, an attack-source (if any), and any number of defending cards.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.0.3" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<h4 id="cr7.0.3a">7.0.3a A chain link is created when an attack is added to the combat chain as a chain link<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/07-combat/#cr7.2.3">[7.2.3]</a></sup>. The attack becomes the active-attack of chain link N+1, where N is the number of existing chain links on the combat chain.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.0.3a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr7.0.3b">7.0.3b The active chain link is the most recent chain link of the combat chain. When chain link N+1 is created, chain link N (if any) becomes the previous chain link and chain link N+1 becomes the active chain link, until the combat chain closes.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.0.3b" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr7.0.3c">7.0.3c When referring to a chain link as a collection, the properties, control, and ownership of a chain link are considered to be the same as the active-attack of that chain link. If the active-attack of a chain link ceases to exist, last known information about the active-attack is used to determine the properties, control, and ownership.<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.2.3">[1.2.3]</a></sup><a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.0.3c" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Double Strike has the text "When this chain link resolves, banish this." Even if the Double Strike ceases to exist, the chain link remains, and is considered a Ninja chain link controlled by the attacking hero.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cr7.0.3d">7.0.3d When referring to a chain link as a time, a chain link starts when it becomes the active chain link and ends when it is no longer the active chain link or the combat chain closes. If an effect states "this chain link" it refers to the active chain link - if there is no active chain link (the combat chain is closed) the effect fails to be generated.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.0.3d" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr7.0.3e">7.0.3e When a layer is added to the stack while the combat chain is open, it is considered to be played/activated/triggered on the active chain link (if any), for rules and effects<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/07-combat/#cr7.0.3b">[7.0.3b]</a></sup>. If there is no active chain link on the combat chain, it is not considered to be played/activated/triggered on any chain link.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.0.3e" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr7.0.3f">7.0.3f To put a card on a chain link, that card moves to the combat chain and is associated with that chain link until it leaves the combat chain.

<h3 id="cr7.0.4">7.0.4 An active-attack, is an attack that has been put onto the combat chain as a chain link<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.4">[1.4]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/07-combat/#cr7.0.3a">[7.0.3a]</a></sup>.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.0.4" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<h4 id="cr7.0.4a">7.0.4a If a card is put onto a chain link as an attacking card, the existing active-attack (if any) is cleared, and the new card becomes the active-attack for that chain link. It is considered a new attack, but the attack target(s) remain the same.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.0.4a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Uzuri has the text "[...] put target attacking card with stealth from the active chain link on the bottom of its owner's deck, then put the banished card onto the active chain link as the attacking card." The card with stealth is essentially replaced by the banished card as the attack on the chain link. The banished card is considered a new attack for rules and effects, except that the target of the attack stays the same.</p>

<h3 id="cr7.0.5">7.0.5 A defending card is a card that is designated as defending on a chain link for an attack-target by a rule or effect<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/07-combat/#cr7.3.2">[7.3.2]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/07-combat/#cr7.4.2d">[7.4.2d]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/08-keywords/#cr8.5.32">[8.5.32]</a></sup>.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.0.5" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<h4 id="cr7.0.5a">7.0.5a To be added as a defending card, the card is put on the respective chain link. The card is considered to be defending until it leaves the combat chain. Then the "defend" event occurs and effects that trigger from defending are triggered. The controller of the card at the time it defends is considered to have defended with that card.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.0.5a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Surging Militia has the text "This gets +1<span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span> for each non-equipment card defending it." and Inertia Trap has the text "When this defends an attack with <span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span> greater than its base, [...]" When Inertia Trap becomes a defending card against Surging Militia, the Surging Militia will gain +1<span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span> before the defend event occurs, and thus Inertia Trap will trigger.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cr7.0.5b">7.0.5b If an effect would add a card on a chain link as a defending card, but the card is already defending on that chain link or the card cannot become a defending card due to another effect, the effect fails, no defend event occurs, and the card does not move zones.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.0.5b" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Amulet of Havencall has the text "Defense Reaction -- Destroy this: Search your deck for a Rally the Rearguard, add it to this chain link as a defending card, then shuffle." If Rally the Rearguard cannot be added as a defending card, it remains in the deck and the deck is shuffled.</p>

If Quickdodge Flexors is already defending card on the active chain link, then its ability is activated, it will remain a defending card on that chain link, no defend event will occur, but its base <span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_d.png" title="Defense" alt="{d}" aria-label=" Defense"></span> will still be set to 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cr7.0.5c">7.0.5c A defending card is considered to be defending against the active-attack on the chain link. If the active-attack ceases to exist, last known information about the active-attack is used to determine the properties, control, and ownership of the attack.<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.2.3">[1.2.3]</a></sup><a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.0.5c" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr7.0.5d">7.0.5d A card can only defend on one chain link for one attack-target at a time. If there are multiple attack-targets and an effect adds a defending card to a chain link but does not specify which attack-target it defends for, the controller of the effect determines which attack-target it will defend for.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.0.5d" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr7.0.5e">7.0.5e If exactly one card is put onto a chain link as a defending card it is considered to defend alone.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If a player declares two cards during the defend step of combat, those cards are considered to defend together.

Declaring a card this way is not considered playing that card - it does not incur the cost of playing that card, it does not add it as a layer on the stack, and it does not resolve any resolution abilities on that card.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.3.2" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<h4 id="cr7.3.2a">7.3.2a If the attack-target is a hero (defending hero), their controller may declare any number of non-defense-reaction cards from their hand and/or public equipment permanents they control.

<h4 id="cr7.3.2b">7.3.2b A card cannot be declared if (A) it does not have the defense property (0 is a value), (B) it is already a defending card on a chain link, or (C) it would make the current set of declared cards illegal to become defending.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.3.2b" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If an attack has overpower (can't be defended by more than one action card) and is already defended by an action card, an action card cannot be declared because it cannot become a defending card.</p>

<h4 id="cr7.3.2c">7.3.2c If a player declares two or more defending cards for an attack-target, they decide the order those cards are declared and become defending.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr7.3.2c" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
