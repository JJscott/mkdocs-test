<h3 id="cr6.1.1">6.1.1 A discrete effect is an effect that changes the game state by producing an event<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.9">[1.9]</a></sup>. Discrete effects have no duration, and after the completion of their event, they have no further influence to the game state.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.1.1" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<h3 id="cr6.1.2">6.1.2 Discrete effects are atomic. If two or more discrete effects would be generated, they are generated and produce their event one at a time.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.1.2" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Sand Sketched Plan has the text "Search your deck for a card, put it into your hand, discard a random card, then shuffle your deck," which is a resolution ability that generates four atomic discrete effects: search (<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/08-keywords/#cr8.5.19">[8.5.19]</a></sup>), put (<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/08-keywords/#cr8.5.15">[8.5.15]</a></sup>), discard (<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/08-keywords/#cr8.5.5">[8.5.5]</a></sup>), and shuffle (<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/08-keywords/#cr8.5.20">[8.5.20]</a></sup>). Each effect is generated and produces an event before the next one in order is generated.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cr6.1.3">6.1.3 If a discrete effect is conditional<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.8.4">[1.8.4]</a></sup>, its condition is evaluated only once, at the time the effect would be generated.

<h2 id="cr6.2">6.2 Continuous Effects<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.2" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h2>
<h3 id="cr6.2.1">6.2.1 A continuous effect modifies the state and properties of objects, and/or the rules of the game. Continuous effects either have a lasting influence effect on the game state, and continue for their specified duration, or for as long as their source ability is functional.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.2.1" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<h3 id="cr6.2.2">6.2.2 A layer-continuous effect is a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a layer. Layer continuous effects typically have a specified duration.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.2.2" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<h4 id="cr6.2.2a">6.2.2a A layer-continuous effect starts as soon it is generated and ends after a specified duration. A specified duration is fixed at the time the effect is generated and does not change once generated. If no duration is explicitly specified by the effect, then the layer-continuous effect ends when it is no longer applicable.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.2.2a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Stasis Cell has the text "[...] activated abilities of target equipment can't be activated until the end of its controller's next turn." which is a layer-continuous effect that has a duration until the current controller's next turn. If the controller of the equipment changes, the duration of the effect does not change.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cr6.2.2b">6.2.2b If a layer-continuous effect has variable values (such as X), the values of those variables are determined when the continuous effect is generated and do not change thereafter. If the effect is a continuous effect that applies to an object that does not yet exist, the variables are determined when the effect first applies to an object and do not change thereafter.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.2.2b" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Tear Limb from Limb has the text "[...] the next Brute attack action card you play this turn gains +X<span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span>, where X is its base <span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span>," which is a layer-continuous effect where X is determined at the time the effect first starts to apply to an object, not when it is first generated.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cr6.2.2c">6.2.2c If a layer-continuous effect starts to apply to an object, it continues to apply to that object even if the properties of that object change.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.2.2c" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Primeval Bellow (red) has the text "Your next Brute attack this turn gains +5<span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span>." If the player plays and resolves Primeval Bellow, then Pack Hunt (a brute attack); even if the supertype brute of Pack Hunt is removed, the effect of Primeval Bellow will still apply to the Pack Hunt.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cr6.2.2d">6.2.2d If a layer-continuous effect is conditional on being generated<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.8.4">[1.8.4]</a></sup>, its condition is evaluated only once, at the time the effect would be generated.

<h4 id="cr6.2.3a">6.2.3a A static-continuous effect starts as soon as the static ability that generated it becomes functional and ends when the static ability becomes non-functional<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.7.4">[1.7.4]</a></sup>.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.2.3a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr6.2.3b">6.2.3b If a static-continuous effect has variable values (such as X), the value of those variables are determined based on the current game state and are updated if the game state changes.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.2.3b" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr6.2.3c">6.2.3c A static-continuous effect only applies to an object while it has the properties described by the effect - if the properties of an object change, the static effect may no longer apply to that object.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.2.3c" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr6.2.3d">6.2.3d If a static-continuous effect is conditional on being generated<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.8.4">[1.8.4]</a></sup>, its condition is evaluated at all times. The effect is generated when the condition is met and ceases to exist when the condition is not met.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.2.3d" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Luminaris has the text "If there is a yellow card in your pitch zone, Illusionist attacks you control have go again," which is a conditional static-continuous effect that only exists when there is a card with a yellow color strip in the controlling player's pitch zone and does not exist otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cr6.2.4">6.2.4 If a continuous effect would only apply to a future object that is yet to exist, it starts to apply to the next object that meets the specification of the effect.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.2.4" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Come to Fight has the text "The next attack action card you play this turn gains +3<span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span>," which is a layer-continuous effect that applies to the next attack action card the player plays after the generation of the effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cr6.2.5">6.2.5 The first time a continuous effect applies to an object, or when a continuous effect changes how it modifies an object, it applies as an event which can be modified by replacement effects and trigger triggered effects. Each application of a continuous effect is considered a separate event.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.2.5" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Talisman of Featherfoot has the text "When an attack you control gains exactly +1<span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span> from an effect during the reaction step, [...]." If an attack has 0 base power and is affected by a -1<span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span> continuous effect, then it is affected by a new +2<span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span> effect during the reaction step, Talisman of Featherfoot would not trigger because an effect of exactly +1<span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span> has not been applied during the reaction step.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cr6.2.5a">6.2.5a If two or more effects would apply to an object at the same time, they are applied in the order determined staging.<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/06-effects/#cr6.3.1">[6.3.1]</a></sup>.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.2.5a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Flourish (yellow) has the text "The next time an attack would gain <span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span> this turn, instead it gains that much plus 3." If there are two static continuous effects that increase <span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span> and would apply to an object at the same time, the player chooses the order of those effects and thus which one is modified by Flourish's replacement effect.</p>

<h2 id="cr6.3">6.3 Continuous Effect Interactions<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.3" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h2>
<h3 id="cr6.3.1">6.3.1 Continuous effects that modify the rules of the game are applied simultaneously before continuous effects that modify objects. If there are two or more continuous effects that modify the state and/or properties of objects in the game, the effects are applied using the staging system. These effects are grouped into stages and are applied in ascending stage order, then if there are two or more effects in the same stage, the effects are applied using substage order, then timestamp order.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.3.1" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Hypothermia has the text "Attacks you control can't gain go again," which is a continuous effect that modifies the rules of the game and is applied before any effects would add the go again ability to an attack you control.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cr6.3.2">6.3.2 Stage order is defined by how an effect applies to the object. Effects are grouped into stages and are applied in ascending stage order. If there are two or more effects in the same stage, the effects are applied using substage order<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/06-effects/#cr6.3.3">[6.3.3]</a></sup>.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.3.2" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>

<li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Effects that modify or are dependent on the controller are applied.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 3:</strong> Effects that modify or are dependent on name, color strip, or text box are applied.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 4:</strong> Effects that modify or are dependent on types or subtypes are applied.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 5:</strong> Effects that modify or are dependent on supertypes are applied.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 6:</strong> Effects that modify or are dependent on abilities are applied.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 7:</strong> Effects that modify or are dependent on the base values of numeric properties are applied.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 8:</strong> Effects and counters that modify or are dependent on the values of numeric properties are applied.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cr6.3.2a">6.3.2a An effect is dependent on a stage if the application of another effect in that stage would have changed the first application of this effect, and that stage is higher than the stage for this effect. An effect is independent if it is not dependent on any stages. Dependent effects are applied in the stage on which they are dependent.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.3.2a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Thump has the text "While Thump's <span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span> is greater than its base <span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span>, it has dominate and 'When this hits a hero, they discard a card.'

Because effects in stage 8 can change the application of Thump's effect, and stage 8 is higher than stage 6, Thump's effect is considered dependent and is applied in stage 8 (substage 7).</p>

<h3 id="cr6.3.3">6.3.3 Substage order is used if there are two or more effects in the same stage and is defined by the dependence and type of modification within each stage. For stages 1--6, substage order is used to apply independent effects before dependent effects. For stages 7--8, effects are grouped into the following substages and are applied in ascending substage order.<em> </em><em>Substage 1:</em>* All effects that add/remove a numerical property to/from the object are applied.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.3.3" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>

<h3 id="cr6.6.6">6.6.6 When a triggered-layer is created, it is added to the stack before the next player receives priority as a game state process.<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.10.2">[1.10.2]</a></sup><a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.6.6" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<h4 id="cr6.6.6a">6.6.6a When a triggered-layer is added to the stack, the player that controls the effect must declare the parameters of all abilities of that layer. If the card has any modal resolution abilities, the player must declare the modes for those abilities<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.7.5">[1.7.5]</a></sup>. Then, if any resolution abilities generate effects that require a target, the player must declare all legal targets for those effects <sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.8.5">[1.8.5]</a></sup>. If no legal targets can be declared, the triggered-layer ceases to exist and is not added to the stack.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.6.6a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Thaw has the text "While Thaw is in your graveyard, at the start of your turn, you may banish it and choose 1: Destroy target Frostbite. Destroy target Ice affliction. Unfreeze target frozen card." To add Thaw's triggered-layer to the stack, the controlling player must first select the mode and choose a legal target for that mode, otherwise the triggered-layer ceases to exist and will not be added to the stack.</p>

<h4 id="cr6.6.6b">6.6.6b If two or more triggered-layers would have been created, the turn player selects a player, then each player in clockwise order adds all pending triggered-layers they control onto the stack in an order they choose, starting with the selected player.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr6.6.6b" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Celestial Kimono has the text "[...] when or a non-token permanent you control with ward is destroyed, gain <span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_r.png" title="Resource" alt="{r}" aria-label=" Resource"></span>." and Diadem of Dreamstate has the text "[...] when this [...] is destroyed, you may pay <span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_r.png" title="Resource" alt="{r}" aria-label=" Resource"></span>. If you do, create a Ponder token. Ward 1." If Diadem of Dreamstate is destroyed, the controlling player may choose to order their trigger-layers so they gain <span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_r.png" title="Resource" alt="{r}" aria-label=" Resource"></span> from Celestial Kimono before paying <span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_r.png" title="Resource" alt="{r}" aria-label=" Resource"></span> for Diadem of Dreamstate, even if they are not the turn player.</p>
