<h2 id="cr5.0">5.0 General<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.0" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h2>
<h2 id="cr5.1">5.1 Playing Cards<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.1" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h2>
<h3 id="cr5.1.1">5.1.1 To play a card is to move it to the stack as a card-layer<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.6.2a">[1.6.2a]</a></sup>. Only a card's owner can play it unless otherwise specified by a rule or effect. Playing a card involves the following steps in order: Announce, Declare Costs, Declare Modes and Targets, Check Legal Play, Calculate Asset-Costs, Pay Asset-Costs, Calculate Effect-Costs, Pay Effect-Costs, and Play.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.1.1" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<h4 id="cr5.1.1a">5.1.1a A player can only play cards from their hand or arsenal zones unless otherwise specified by a rule or effect.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.1.1a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h3 id="cr5.1.2">5.1.2 <strong>Announce</strong>: First, the player proposes the card to be played. The card moves to the stack zone under that player's control and becomes the topmost layer of the stack.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.1.2" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<h4 id="cr5.1.2a">5.1.2a Effects that apply to the next card played are applied if the card matches the effect description. Effects that are dependent on any undetermined parameters of the card are applied when those parameters are declared.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.1.2a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> There are three continuous effects active: "The next attack action card you play gains +3<span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span>," "Action cards cost <span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_r.png" title="Resource" alt="{r}" aria-label=" Resource"></span> less to play," and "Attack action cards you control have +3<span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span>." When an attack action card is proposed to be played and is moved to the stack under the player's control, all three effects begin to apply immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Goliath Gauntlet has the text "The next attack action card with cost 2 or greater you play this turn gets +2<span class="inline-icon"><img src="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/assets/images/icon_p.png" title="Power" alt="{p}" aria-label=" Power"></span>." If you play an attack action card with a cost of X, at the time you declare the value of X to be 2 or more, Goliath Gauntlet's effect will apply. If you declare X to be 0 or 1, Goliath Gauntlet will not apply.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cr5.1.2b">5.1.2b A card may only be announced to be played if a rule or existing effect allows it to be played.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.1.2b" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Tome of Torment has the text "You may play Tome of Torment from your banished zone." which is a play-static ability that when functional, allows it to be played from the banished zone. If Tome of Torment is private (face-down) in the banished zone, its play-static ability is not functional and therefore it cannot be announced to be played.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cr5.1.2c">5.1.2c If the card is a split-card, the player declares which side the split-card will be played with<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/09-additional-rules/#cr9.2.3">[9.2.3]</a></sup>. If the split-card has meld<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/08-keywords/#cr8.3.38">[8.3.38]</a></sup> the player may declare that the card is played with both sides. The declared side(s) determines the card's properties when put onto the stack and any subsequent effects applied to it.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.1.2c" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A player may play Null||Shock by declaring one of its sides (Null or Shock), or by declaring both sides using meld. Doing so determines the name, types, and abilities of the card on the stack until it ceases to exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cr5.1.3">5.1.3 <strong>Declare Costs</strong>: Second, the player declares the parameters for any costs of the proposed card.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.1.3" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<h4 id="cr5.1.3a">5.1.3a If the card has a variable cost that includes X, the player must declare the value of X<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.12.2">[1.12.2]</a></sup>. If the player uses an effect to play the card without paying the cost that includes X, then the player must declare X as 0.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.1.3a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr5.1.3b">5.1.3b If the card has additional costs that are optional, the player must declare all additional costs that will be paid.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.1.3b" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr5.1.3c">5.1.3c If the card has an alternative cost or an effect that allows the player to play the card without paying the cost, the player must declare if the alternative cost will be paid or the effect will be used. If a card has two or more alternative costs and/or effects that allow the player to play the card without paying the cost, the player may only declare one (if any) of these.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.1.3c" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr5.1.3d">5.1.3d If the card has the type action and it may be played as an instant, the player declares whether or not they are playing the card as an instant.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.1.3d" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr5.1.3e">5.1.3e If there are two or more effect-costs to be paid, the player declares the order those costs will be paid.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.1.3e" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>

<h4 id="cr5.1.4a">5.1.4a If the card has any modal resolution abilities, the player must declare the modes for those abilities<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.7.5">[1.7.5]</a></sup>. Then, if any resolution abilities generate effects that require a target, the player must declare all legal targets for those effects<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.8.5">[1.8.5]</a></sup>.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.1.4a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr5.1.4b">5.1.4b If the card is an attack, the player must declare the target(s) of the attack<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.4.5">[1.4.5]</a></sup>.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.1.4b" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h3 id="cr5.1.5">5.1.5 <strong>Check Legal Play</strong>: Fourth, the card is evaluated if it is legal to play before any costs are paid. If a rule or effect prevents the card from being played, or the parameters of the proposed card are illegal, the card is illegal to play and the game state is reversed to before the card was announced.<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.10.3">[1.10.3]</a></sup><a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.1.5" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>

If two or more effects are applied at each step, then they are applied in timestamp order<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/06-effects/#cr6.3.4">[6.3.4]</a></sup>.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.1.6a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>

<h4 id="cr5.2.1a">5.2.1a The LIMIT (if any) is written at the start of the ability and specifies the maximum number of times the ability can be activated. If there is no limit, the ability can be activated any number of times.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.2.1a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr5.2.1b">5.2.1b The TYPE is written directly before the hyphen and specifies the type of the ability and the type of the activated-layer created by activating the ability.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.2.1b" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr5.2.1c">5.2.1c The COST is written between the dash and colon. It specifies the cost to be paid to activate the ability. A cost of "0" specifies the resource cost to activate the ability is zero.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.2.1c" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr5.2.1d">5.2.1d The ABILITIES are written after the colon and specify the base abilities of the activated-layer. When the activated-layer resolves, the resolution abilities of the layer generate effects.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.2.1d" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr5.2.1e">5.2.1e The CONDITION (if any) is written at the end of the ability and specifies the activation condition.

<h3 id="cr5.2.2">5.2.2 To activate an activated ability is to create an activated-layer on the stack. A player can only activate an activated ability if they have priority, the ability is functional<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/01-game-concepts/#cr1.7.4">[1.7.4]</a></sup>, and the player controls its source (or owns its source if there is no controller), unless otherwise specified by a rule or effect. Activating an activated ability involves the following:<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.2.2" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<h4 id="cr5.2.2a">5.2.2a Announce the activated ability to be activated. The activated-layer is created in the stack zone under that player's control and becomes the topmost layer of the stack. The activated-layer is created with the same supertypes and types as the source of the activated ability. Continuous effects begin to apply to the ability layer.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.2.2a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr5.2.2b">5.2.2b The remainder of the process for activating an activated ability is identical to the process for playing a card listed in steps <sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/05-layers-cards-abilities/#cr5.1.3">[5.1.3]</a></sup>-<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/05-layers-cards-abilities/#cr5.1.10">[5.1.10]</a></sup>, substituting "play" for 'activate`, and "card" for "ability."<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.2.2b" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h3 id="cr5.2.3">5.2.3 If an effect allows an ability to be activated additional times, that activated ability may be activated to exceed its LIMIT by the specified amount of times.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.2.3" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<h4 id="cr5.2.3a">5.2.3a If an effect allows all abilities on an object to be activated additional times and the object has two or more activated abilities, each activated ability of that object can be activated additional times.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.2.3a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Snap Shot has the text "[...] you may activate abilities of bows you control an additional time this turn and as though they were an instant," which allows each individual activated ability on bows the player controls to be activated an additional time.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cr5.2.3b">5.2.3b If an effect allows an object to be activated additional times and the object has two or more activated abilities, the effect applies at the time the ability is activated beyond its LIMIT. The total number of additional activations may be spread across all activated abilities on the object.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.2.3b" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Tri-shot has the text "You may activate target bow you control 2 additional times this turn," which allows the activated abilities on the target bow to be activated a combined total of 2 additional times.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cr5.2.3c">5.2.3c If an effect allows a source to attack additional times, it refers to activating an ability on the source with the attack ability (<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/08-keywords/#cr8.3.1">[8.3.1]</a></sup>) or attack effect (<sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/08-keywords/#cr8.5.38">[8.5.38]</a></sup>).<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.2.3c" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Twinning Blade has the text "You may attack an additional time with target sword this turn," which allows the player to activate an activated ability (with the attack ability/effect) on the target sword an additional time past its LIMIT.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cr5.2.3d">5.2.3d Effects that allow the additional activation of an activated ability are additive. If two or more effects would allow an activated ability to be activated beyond its LIMIT, the player chooses which of those effects apply to the activation.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.2.3d" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h4 id="cr5.2.3e">5.2.3e Effects that state how many times an ability can be activated in total, set the LIMIT of the activated ability (or the total number of times that all activated abilities), which can be surpassed by effects that allow the ability to be activated additional times.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.2.3e" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Blood on Her Hands has the text "[...] Target 1H weapon may attack twice this turn," which is an effect that sets the total number of times an activated ability (with the attack effect) can be activated on the target to two. If this effect is applied two or more times, the activated ability (with the attack effect) can still only be activated twice.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cr5.2.4">5.2.4 If an activated ability's cost can only be paid when the source is private, or if its activation condition specifies the privacy status and/or zone of its source, the ability is functional when the source meets that requirement.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.2.4" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
<h4 id="cr5.2.4a">5.2.4a If an activated ability is functional, but its source has no controller, then the owner may activate the ability instead.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.2.4a" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Vigorous Windup has the text "Instant -- Discard this: Create a Vigor token." This ability is functional while the card is in its owner's hand. The owner may activate the ability despite not controlling the source.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cr5.2.4b">5.2.4b If a player activates an ability of a private source, the source of the ability becomes public until either the activated-layer resolves or ceases to exist, or the source ceases to exist. When an object becomes public this way, it does not trigger any abilities and cannot be replaced by any replacement effects.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.2.4b" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h4>
<h2 id="cr5.3">5.3 Resolution Abilities &amp; Resolving Layers<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.3" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h2>
<h3 id="cr5.3.1">5.3.1 A resolution ability is an ability that generates effects when its source resolves as a layer on the stack. If the stack is not empty and all players pass in succession, the top layer of the stack resolves, except the Layer Step of combat <sup><a href="https://jjscott.nz/mkdocs-test/en/cr/07-combat/#cr7.1">[7.1]</a></sup>. When a layer resolves it does so in the following order: Check resolution, Static effects, Layer effects, Go again, Leave stack, Clear.<a class="headerlink" href="#cr5.3.1" title="Permanent link">Â§</a></h3>
