1 Game Concepts
1.0 General
1.0.1 The rules in this document apply to any game of Flesh and Blood.
1.0.1a If an effect directly contradicts a rule contained in this document, the effect supersedes that rule.
1.0.1b If a tournament rule contradicts a rule contained in this document or an effect, the tournament rule supersedes that rule or that effect.
1.0.2 A restriction is a rule or effect that states something cannot happen. A requirement is a rule or effect that states that something should happen if possible. An allowance is a rule or effect that states something can happen. A restriction takes precedence over any requirement or allowance, and a requirement takes precedence over any allowance, subject to [1.0.1a].
Example: "They can't defend this with equipment" is a restriction, "They must defend this with equipment they control if able" is a requirement, and "They may defend this with equipment they control" is an allowance.
Example: If one effect reads "You can't play cards from your banished zone," and another effect reads "You may play cards from your banished zone," the restriction takes precedence over the allowance and the player cannot play cards from their banished zone.
1.0.2a A restriction that states that "only" something can happen is functionally equivalent to a restriction that states everything else cannot happen.
Example: Three of a Kind has the text "[...] you may only play cards from arsenal," which is a restriction equivalent to "you cannot play cards from anywhere other than arsenal." Even if an effect would allow you to play a card from your banished zone (an allowance), or require you to play your next card from hand (a requirement) you would not be able to play that card because of the restriction effect generated by Three of a Kind.
1.0.2b A restriction or requirement does not retroactively change the game state.
Example: Overpower is an ability with an effect that prevents its source from being defended by more than 1 action card (a restriction). If an attack is already defended by two or more action cards and then it gains overpower, none of the existing defending cards are retroactively removed from defending.
1.1 Players
1.1.1 A player is a person participating in the game.
1.1.1a To participate, a person must have a hero, a card-pool, a way to represent any tokens and counters that could be created by effects in their card-pool, a way to generate uniform random values for effects in their card-pool, a play-space for zones, and a method to record life totals.
1.1.2 A player's hero is a hero-card.[1.3.2a]
1.1.2a This document distinguishes the player as the person participating in the game and the hero as the hero card of a player.
1.1.2b A player plays the game as their hero. Card text makes no distinction between the player and their hero, identifying both identically; the term "you" refers to the player's hero and the term "opponent" refers to the player's opponent's hero.
1.1.3 A player's card-pool is a collection of deck-cards[1.3.2c] and arena-cards[1.3.2d]. A card can only be included in a player's card-pool if the card's supertypes are a subset of their hero's supertypes.[2.11]
Example: If the hero card is Boltyn (supertypes of "Light" and "Warrior"), the card-pool can only include cards with the supertypes of "Light Warrior," "Light," "Warrior," and cards with no supertypes ("Generic").
1.1.3a If an effect allows a player to start the game with one or more cards with supertypes that are not a subset of their hero's supertypes, those cards may be included in the player's card-pool as long as they start the game as specified by the effect[4.1.6c]. Card text of meta-static abilities refers to the player's card-pool as the player's "deck."
1.1.3b A hybrid card may be included in a player's card-pool if either of the hybrid card's supertype sets is a subset of their hero's supertypes.[2.14.1b]
1.1.4 In a game, a party comprises players who win the game together.
1.1.4a A player is always considered to be in a party with themselves, including when they are the only player in that party.
Example: United we Stand has the text "[...] if Boltyn is in your party, create a Courage token under his control." If the player is playing as Boltyn, they would create a Courage token under their own control because they are considered to be in their own party, even if there are no other players in their party.
1.1.5 In a game, a player's opponents include all other players who are not in their party.[1.1.4]
1.1.6 Clockwise order is the order of players starting from the given player and progressing clockwise among the players when viewed from above. The next player in clockwise order is the player to the left of the given player.
1.2 Objects
1.2.1 An object is an element of the game with properties[2] and located in a zone[3] or a player's inventory[4.1.6]. Cards, attacks, macros, and layers are objects.
1.2.1a The owner of an object is the same as the card, macro, or layer that represents it, otherwise it has no owner.
1.2.1b The controller of an object is the same as the card, macro, or layer that represents it. An object does not have a controller if it is not in the arena or on the stack.
1.2.2 An object has one or more object identities that can be referred to. Rules in this document and effects typically describe objects using their object identity as the noun.
Example: Lunging Press has the text "Target attack action card gains +1{p}," which identifies the target of the effect, using the "card" object identity as the noun.
1.2.2a An object has the object identity "object."
1.2.2b An object with a name property and/or moniker has the object identity of that name and/or moniker.[2.7]
Example: Dorinthea, Quicksilver Prodigy has the text "The first time Dawnblade, Resplendent gets go again each turn, [...]," which identifies an object using the name "Dawnblade, Resplendent" as an object identity.
1.2.2c A card has the object identity of its traits, types, and subtypes, except for the subtype attack.
Example: Ironsong Determination has the text "Target weapon gets +1{p} and dominate until end-of turn," which identifies an object using the type "weapon" as an object identity.
1.2.2d A card with the subtype attack on the stack, an attack-proxy on the stack, an attack-layer on the stack, or an attacking object on the combat chain has the object identity "attack."[1.4]
Example: Oath of the Arknight has the text "Your next Runeblade attack this turn gains +3{p}," which identifies either a Runeblade attack action card on the stack, or attack-proxy created by a Runeblade source, or an attacking Runeblade object; using "attack" as an object identity.
1.2.2e A card has the object identity "card."
1.2.2f A permanent has the object identity "permanent."[1.3.3]
1.2.2g An activated-layer has the object identity "activated ability."
1.2.2h A triggered-layer has the object identity "triggered effect."
1.2.3 Last known information about an object is a snapshot of the state of an object immediately before it ceased to exist.
1.2.3a If a rule or effect requires information about a specific object that no longer exists, instead it uses last known information about that object to fulfil that requirement. Otherwise, if a rule or effect does not specifically refer to that object, last known information is not used.
Example: Endless Arrow has the text "When Endless Arrow hits, put it into your hand." If Endless Arrow hits, it is put into the player's hand. The chain link of Endless Arrow then holds the last known information about Endless Arrow, so that if it had the ability "go again" before it was put into hand the player would still gain an action point when the chain link resolves.
1.2.3b Last known information about an object includes all parameters, history, and effects applicable to that object at the time it still existed.
1.2.3c Last known information about an object is immutable - it cannot be altered. Rules and effects that would modify the object that no longer exists do not modify the last known information about an object; this may cause effects to fail.
Example: Luminaris has the text "If there is a yellow card in your pitch zone, your Illusionist attacks get go again." If you controlled an Illusionist attack as a chain link on the combat chain, but it was removed, and then you put a yellow card in your pitch zone to meet Luminaris's condition, the chain link does not have go again because the last known information about the attack cannot be altered.
1.2.3d Last known information about an object is not an object itself - it is not a legal target for rules and effects.
1.2.4 Card and macro objects are the source of abilities, effects, non-card layers, and attack-proxies.
Example: Oasis Respite has the text "Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to target hero this turn by a source of your choice." Only cards or macros can be declared as the source for Oasis Respite's effect. Any damage that would be dealt by the chosen source may be subject to the prevention effect.
1.3 Cards
1.3.1 A card is an object represented by an official Flesh and Blood card. The properties of a card are determined by the true text of the card on https://cards.fabtcg.com.
1.3.1a The owner of a card is the player who started the game with that card as their hero or as part of their card-pool, or the player instructed to create it or otherwise put it into the game.
1.3.1b A card does not have a controller unless it is in the arena or on the stack. The controller of a card is its owner as it enters the arena or the player who played that card.
1.3.2 There are 4 categories of cards: hero-, token-, deck-, and arena-cards.
1.3.2a A hero-card is any card with the type hero. A hero-card starts the game as a player's hero.
1.3.2b A token-card is any card with the type token. A token-card is not considered part of a player's card-pool.[1.1.3]
1.3.2c A deck-card is any card with one of the following types: Action, Attack Reaction, Block, Defense Reaction, Instant, Mentor, and Resource. A deck-card may start the game in a player's deck.
1.3.2d An arena-card is any non-hero- non-token- non-deck-card. An arena-card cannot start the game in a player's deck.
1.3.3 A permanent is a card in the arena that remains there indefinitely, or until they are destroyed, banished, or otherwise removed by an effect or game rule. Hero-cards, arena-cards, and token-cards are permanents while they are in the arena. Deck-cards become permanents when they are put into the arena (but not the combat chain) and they have one of the following subtypes: Affliction, Ally, Ash, Aura, Construct, Figment, Invocation, Item, and Landmark[2.10].
1.3.3a If a permanent leaves the arena, it is no longer considered a permanent.
1.3.4 A card is distinct from another card if one or more of its faces has a name and/or pitch value the other card does not have.
Example: Sink Below with 1 pitch (and a red color bar) is distinct from Sink Below with 2 pitch (and a yellow color bar).
Example: The split-card Null||Shock is distinct from Vaporize||Shock because one of the names (Null) is not present on Vaporize||Shock.
1.4 Attacks
1.4.1 An attack is an object on the stack or combat chain that represents an act of combat. Attack-cards, attack-layers, and attack-proxies are attacks.
1.4.1a The owner of an attack is the same as the owner of the card or activated ability that represents it.
1.4.1b The controller of an attack is the same as the controller of the object that represents it.
1.4.2 An attack-card is a card with the subtype attack that is on the stack or that is attacking on the combat chain.
1.4.2a A card with the subtype attack is only considered an attack if it is on the stack or if it was put onto the combat chain as an attack. Otherwise, it is not considered an attack.
1.4.3 An attack-proxy is a non-card object with the attack ability[8.3.1] that represents the attack of another object (attack-source).
Example: Bone Basher has the text, "Once per Turn Action -- {r}{r}: Attack" which is an activated ability that creates an attack-proxy. The attack-proxy is a representation of Bone Basher's attack.
1.4.3a An attack-proxy is a separate object that acts as an extension of its attack-source[1.4.3b]. It can only be referenced by effects using the object identity "attack"[1.2.2], but is considered to inherit the properties of its attack-source in addition to any existing properties it has, with the exception of the activated and resolution abilities of its attack-source. An attack-proxy is not a copy of its source and does not have a copy of its source's properties.
Example: Edge of Autumn is a two-handed Ninja sword weapon with 1{p} and has the text "Once per Turn Action -- {r}: Attack. Go again." When Edge of Autumn is activated to create an attack-proxy on the stack, the attack-proxy has the base ability 'go again' and inherits the 'Edge of Autumn' name, supertype Ninja, type weapon, subtypes (2H) and sword, and the 1{p} properties from its source.
Example: Burn Them All has a base 'go again' resolution ability and an attack ability gained from Reality Refractor. When Burn Them All is activated to create an attack-proxy on the stack, the attack-proxy does not have 'go again' because it does not inherit the resolution abilities from its source.
Example: Flail of Agony has the text 'When this hits, create a Runechant token." which is a triggered static ability. When Flail of Agony is activated to create an attack-proxy, and the attack-proxy hits, only one Runechant is created because there is only one copy of the triggered static ability.
1.4.3b An attack-source is an object that is represented by an attack-proxy.
Example: Cintari Sellsword has an attack-ability, that produces an attack-proxy when activated. This attack-proxy represents the attack-source, Cintari Sellsword, during combat.
1.4.3c An attack-proxy exists as long as its attack-source exists, and as long as the attack-source is on the same chain link (if the attack-proxy is on the combat chain). If an attack-proxy is on the stack and the attack-source ceases to exist, or an attack-proxy is on the combat chain and the attack-source is not on the same chain link, the attack-proxy ceases to exist. An attack-proxy is not dependent on its attack-source having the {p} property, or the ability that created the attack-proxy.
Example: If a player attacks with a weapon, they create an attack-proxy, and the attack-proxy and the weapon (the attack-source) move to chain link 1. If the player attacks again with the same weapon during the same combat chain, a second attack-proxy is created, that attack-proxy and the weapon (on chain link 1) move to chain link 2, and the first attack-proxy ceases to exist. Last known information is used for the first attack-proxy and chain link 1.
Example: Iris of Reality has the text "[...] Illusionist auras you control are weapons with 4 base {p} and "Once per Turn Action -- {r}{r}{r}: Attack. Go again"." If an Illusionist aura creates an attack-proxy with this ability, then Iris of Reality ceases to exist, the attack-proxy does not cease to exist.
1.4.3d If an effect applies to an attack-source, the modified properties of the object are inherited by the attack-proxy. Replacement effects that modify effects that apply to attacks do not modify effects that apply to the attack-source.
Example: Ironsong Determination has the text "Target weapon gets +1{p} and dominate until end of turn," which applies to a weapon, and is inherited by any attack-proxies of that weapon. A weapon with 3{p} would be modified to have 4{p}, and its attack-proxies would also have 4{p}.
Example: Thrive has the text "If an attack wo uld gain {p} this turn, instead it gains that much plus 1." If a player resolves Thrive, attacks with a weapon, then plays an instant card that increases the {p} of the weapon, Thrive's effect would not modify the increase in power to the attack because the effect modifies the weapon and does not specifically modify the attack-proxy of the weapon.
1.4.3e Effects that reference or apply specifically to an attack-proxy do not reference or apply to its attack-source.
Example: Sharpen Steel has the text "Your next weapon attack this turn gains +3{p}," which applies only to the attack-proxy created by a weapons abilities and then applies to the weapon as an attack on the combat chain; it does not continue to apply to the weapon when the weapon is no longer that specific attack on the combat chain.
1.4.4 An attack-layer is a layer with the attack effect[8.5.38] that represents an attack with no properties on the stack.
Example: Emperor, Dracai of Aesir has the text "Action -- {r}{r}{r}: Search your deck for Command and Conquer, attack with it, then shuffle," which is an activated ability that creates an attack-layer. The attack-layer is a representation of an attack with no properties because it needs to resolve before the Command and Conquer is found.
1.4.4a An attack-layer is not an extension of its attack-source. For the purposes of effects, the attack-layer is considered to be either a typical layer or an attack with no properties, but not both.
Example: The attack-layer created by Emperor, Dracai of Aesir is considered to be either a Royal Draconic Warrior Wizard Hero activated-layer or an attack for the purposes of effects. It is not a Royal Draconic Warrior Wizard Hero activated ability attack. Uprising has the text "Your next 4 Draconic attacks this turn gain +1{p}," which is a continuous effect that would not apply to this attack-layer because it is not considered a Draconic attack.
1.4.4b An attack-layer is considered a separate object from its attack-source for an effect that applies specifically to attacks. If an effect does not apply to an attack layer, it may still apply to the attack-source if it meets the specifications of the effect.
1.4.5 An attack-target is the target of an attack that is declared when the attack is put onto the stack. If a player plays or activates an attack, or adds a triggered-layer to the stack with an attack effect, the player must declare an attackable object controlled by an opponent as the attack-target.[5.1.4][6.6.6a]
1.4.5a An object is attackable if it is a living object[2.5.1], or if it is made attackable by an effect.
Example: The ability Spectra generates an effect that makes its source a legal target for an attack, despite it not being a living object.
1.4.5b An attack-target remains the target of the attack until the combat chain closes. The player does not have to declare the same target as a previous attack on the combat chain; declaring a different target to a previous attack does not close the combat chain.
1.4.5c If an effect modifies an attack to have multiple targets, all targets must be separate and legal to declare.
1.4.6 An attack cannot be played or activated if a rule or effect would prevent the player from attacking with that card or ability.
1.5 Macros
1.5.1 A macro is a non-card object in the arena.
Note: A macro is not a card, even if it is represented by an official Flesh and Blood card. Macros are determined by tournament rules for specific formats.
Example: Sanctuary of Aria is a macro with the text "Instant -- {r}{r}: Prevent the next 1 damage that would be dealt to you this turn by a source of your choice. Destroy this at the beginning of the end phase."
1.5.1a A macro has no owner.
1.5.1b The controller of a macro is determined by the tournament rule that created it.
1.5.2 A macro cannot be and is not considered part of a player's card-pool.[1.1.3]
1.5.3 If a macro leaves the arena, it is removed from the game.
1.6 Layers
1.6.1 A layer is an object on the stack[3.15] that is yet to be resolved. Card-layers, activated-layers, and triggered-layers are layers.
1.6.1a The owner of a card-layer is the player who owns the card. The owner of an activated-layer is the player who activated the activated ability. The owner of a triggered-layer is the player who controlled the source of the triggered effect when the triggered-layer was created.
1.6.1b The controller of a layer is the player that put it on the stack.
1.6.2 There are 3 categories of layers: card-, activated-, and triggered-layers.
1.6.2a A card-layer is a layer represented by a card on the stack.
1.6.2b An activated-layer is a layer created by an activated ability. An activated-layer is created on the stack, and then can only exist on the stack.[5.2]
Example: Energy Potion has the text "Instant – Destroy Energy Potion: Gain {r}{r}," which is an activated ability. When this ability is activated, it creates an activated-layer on the stack with the resolution ability "Gain {r}{r}."
1.6.2c A triggered-layer is a layer created by a triggered effect. A triggered-layer is created before it is put on the stack, and then can only exist on the stack.[6.6]
Example: Snatch has the text "When Snatch hits, draw a card," which is a triggered effect. When this effect is triggered, it creates a triggered-layer to be put on the stack with the resolution ability "Draw a card."
1.7 Abilities
1.7.1 An ability is a property of an object that influences the game by generating effects or by creating a layer on the stack that resolves and generates effects. The base abilities of a non-token card are determined by its rules text[2.12]. The base abilities of a token card, macro, or non-card layer are defined by a rule, or the effect or ability that created it.
1.7.1a The source of an ability is the card or token that has that ability. The source of am ability of an activated-layer or triggered-layer is the same as the source of the ability that created that layer. Activated-layers and triggered-layers exist independently of their source - if the source of an activated-layer or triggered-layer ceases to exist, it does not prevent the resolution of that layer.
1.7.1b The controller of an activated-layer is the player who activated its source. The controller of a triggered-layer is the player who controlled its source when it triggered - if the source has no controller, the controller of the triggered-layer is player who owns the source.
1.7.2 If an object has an ability as a property, it is considered a card with that ability. If the ability is a base ability, it is considered a card with that base ability.
Example: Torrent of Tempo has the text "When this hits, it gets go again." Torrent of Tempo is not a card with base go again. Until Torrent of Tempo hits, it is not a card with go again - once Torrent of Tempo hits and the triggered-layer resolves, Torrent of Tempo will be a card with go again, but still not a card with base go again.
1.7.3 There are three categories of abilities: activated abilities, resolution abilities, and static abilities. An ability is categorized based on how it generates effects.
1.7.3a Activated abilities can be activated by a player to put an activated-layer on the stack.[5.2]
1.7.3b Resolution abilities generate effects when a layer with the ability resolves on the stack.[5.3]
1.7.3c Static abilities simply generate effects.[5.4]
1.7.4 An activated ability can only be activated when it is functional. A resolution or static ability only generates its effects when it is functional. An ability is functional when its source is public and in the arena; otherwise, it is non-functional, with the following exceptions:
1.7.4a An ability of a non-permanent defending card[7.0.5] is non-functional unless the ability is an activated ability that specifies it can be activated when the card is defending, a triggered ability with a trigger condition that includes the card defending, or a static ability that is stated as an exception.
Example: Rally the Rearguard has the text "Once per Turn Instant -- Discard a card: Rally the Rearguard gains +3{d}. Activate this ability only while Rally the Rearguard is defending," which is functional when it is a non-permanent defending card because the activated ability states it can only be activated when the card is defending.
1.7.4b An activated ability is functional if its cost can only be paid, or it explicitly specifies it can be activated, when the source is private or outside the arena, and the source meets that condition.[5.2.4]
Example: Mighty Windup has the text "Instant -- Discard this: Create a Might token," which is functional when it is in the owner's hand because the cost can only be paid when Mighty Windup is in the owner's hand.
Example: Guardian of the Shadowrealm has the text "Action -- {r}{r}: Return Guardian of the Shadowrealm to your hand. Active this ability only while Guardian of the Shadowrealm is in your banished zone," which is functional when it is face-up in the owner's banished zone.
1.7.4c A resolution ability is functional when its source object resolves as a layer on the stack, otherwise, it is non-functional.[5.3]
Example: Sigil of Solace has the text "Gain 3{h}," which is a resolution ability that is functional as the card resolves as a layer on the stack to produce its effect.
1.7.4d A meta-static ability is functional outside the game.[5.4.3]
Example: The Specialization keyword is a meta-static ability that prevents the player from including the card in their deck if the specialization does not match their hero card's first name, which is functional outside the game.
1.7.4e A play-static ability is functional when its source is public in any zone and when it is played.[5.4.4]
Example: Ghostly Visit has the text "You may play Ghostly Visit from your banished zone," which is a play-static ability that is functional when playing Ghostly Visit, because it affects the rules of how it is allowed to be played.
1.7.4f A property-static ability is functional when its source is in any zone or outside the game.[5.4.5]
Example: The {p} and {d} of Mutated Mass are defined by a property-static ability which is functional at all times, based on the current total number of different costed cards in the pitch zone in the current game state.
1.7.4g A while-static ability is functional when its while-condition is met.[5.4.7]
Example: Yinti Yanti has the text "While Yinti Yanti is defending and you control an aura, it has +1{d}," which is a while-static ability that is functional when it is a non-permanent defending card because it has a while-condition that is met when the card is defending.
1.7.4h A static ability is functional when its source resolves as a layer on the stack and/or as its source enters the arena.
Example: Conduit of Frostburn has the text "The next card you play this turn with an effect that deals arcane damage gains 'When this deals arcane damage to a hero, [...]'~," which gives a card a static ability that is functional when its source resolves as a layer on the stack.
1.7.4i A triggered-static ability, with a triggered condition that its source is outside the arena, is functional when the source meets that condition.
Example: Back Alley Breakline has the text "When an activated ability or action card effect puts Back Alley Breakline face up into a zone from your deck, gain 1 action point," which is a triggered-static ability that is functional when an activated ability or action card effect puts it into that zone from the deck.
1.7.4j A static ability, with a replacement effect that modifies the event of its source moving zones, is functional when the source meets that condition.
Example: Drone of Brutality has the text "If Drone of Brutality would be put into your graveyard from anywhere, instead put it on the bottom of your deck," which is a static ability with a replacement effect that is functional when Drone of Brutality would be moved to the graveyard zone.
1.7.5 A modal ability is a choice of modes, where each mode is a base ability the source could have. A modal ability typically contains the phrase "choose [X] [CONDITIONS?]; [MODES]" where X is a cardinal number or a description of the number of modes to choose, CONDITIONS (if any) specifies one or more conditions for selecting modes, and MODES is a list of modes that can be selected.
1.7.5a Modes of the source are declared as the source is added as a layer on the stack.[5.1.4][6.6.6a]
1.7.5b If the modal ability allows the player to select two or more modes, they cannot select the same mode more than once, unless specified by the ability. If the player may select more modes than are available, they can only select a maximum of the available modes. If two or more modes are selected, the player decides the order of those modes at the time they are declared.
Example: Art of War has the text "Choose 2; [...]" followed by four modal options. Because the ability does not state that the player can choose the same option more than once, two distinct modes must be selected.
1.7.5c If the same mode is selected more than once, the modes are considered separate and do not create a compound event[1.9.2]. If the mode contains a targeted effect, the same target(s) may be selected for each time the mode is selected.
Example: Blood on Her Hands has the text "Target 1H weapon has +1{p} while attacking this turn," which is a mode that can be selected more than once. As a targeted effect, the player may target the same 1H  weapon each time it is chosen as a mode.
1.7.5d Once the modes of a modal ability have been selected, those modes determine the base abilities of the source for rules and effects. If no modes for the source have been selected it is considered to not have any of those modes as base abilities.
1.7.5e If the number or the availability of modes is affected by a conditional or an undetermined parameter, the conditional or parameter is evaluated at the time the modes are selected.
Example: Sacred Art: Undercurrent Desires has the text "If you've played another blue card this turn, choose 3. Otherwise, choose 1; [...]" The number of modes is determined at the time Sacred Art: Undercurrent Desires is played, and the modes are selected, not when it resolves.
1.7.6 A connected ability pair is a pair of abilities where the parameters and/or events of one connected ability (leading ability) are specifically referred to by the effect(s) of the other connected ability (following ability).
Example: Reckless Swing has the text "As an additional cost to play Reckless Swing, discard a random card," which is a leading play-static ability that requires the player to discard a card, and "If the discarded card has 6 or more Attack, deal 2 damage to the attacking hero," which is a following resolution ability with an effect that directly refers to the card discarded from the event generated by an effect in the leading ability.
1.7.6a An ability can be part of one or more connected ability pairs. An ability can be both a leading and following ability for different connected ability pairs.
1.7.6b If a following ability cannot refer to the parameters and/or events of the leading ability, or if there are no parameters and/or events to refer to, the relevant effects of the following ability fail.
1.7.6c If an effect adds a connected ability pair (both the leading and following abilities) to an object, they are connected on that object and the added following ability will only refer to the added leading ability. If only one of the abilities is added, or both abilities are added by separate effects, then they are not connected on the object they are added to.
1.7.7 The abilities of an object can be modified.
1.8 Effects
1.8.1 An effect is generated by an ability or another effect, and can change the game state by producing events or applying changes to objects or the game itself. When a layer resolves, a static ability becomes functional, a card/ability with an alternative/additional effect-cost is played/activated, or the conditions of another effect are met, it may generate one or more discrete and/or continuous effects.
1.8.1a The source of an effect is the same as the source of the ability or effect that generated it, unless otherwise specified by the effect.
Example: Electrify has the text "The next time an attack action card hits a hero this turn, it deals 3 damage to them," which is a delayed-triggered effect that triggers to deal damage, specifying the source of the damage effect as the attack action card that caused the effect to trigger.
1.8.1b The controller of an effect is the same as the controller of the ability or effect that generated it unless otherwise specified by the effect.
1.8.2 If the abilities of an object directly generate an effect, the object is considered an object with that effect. This includes optional and conditional effects.
Example: Chain Lightning has the text "If you've played another Wizard non-attack action card this turn, deal 3 arcane damage to each opposing hero." Because the ability generates a deal (damage) effect, Chain Lightning is considered a card with an effect that deals 3 arcane damage, even though it is conditional.
Example: Blazing Aether has the text "Deal X arcane damage to target hero, [...]" Because the ability generates a deal (damage) effect, Blazing Aether is considered a card with an effect that deals X arcane damage, where X is 0 until the card resolves and X is defined.
Example: Clash of Might has the text "When this defends, clash with the attacking hero." Because the ability generates a clash effect, Clash of Might is considered a card with clash.
Example: Thunk has the text "When you win a clash revealing this, create a Might token." Because the ability does not generate a clash effect, Thunk is not considered a card with clash.
1.8.3 An optional effect is an effect that the player may choose to be generated. An optional effect typically contains the term "may."
1.8.3a When an optional effect would be generated, or would apply to objects or the game, the player instructed by the effect chooses whether or not to generate or apply the effect.
1.8.3b If any of the optional effects cannot be generated due to a rule or effect, cannot resolve successfully based on the current game state, or contain an asset-cost which cannot be paid[1.14.2], the effect cannot be generated/applied and the player cannot choose to generate/apply the effect. If the optional effects are phrased with "may choose to" then the player may choose to generate the effects regardless of their outcome.
Example: Murky Water has the text "[...] you may banish face-down 3 traps from your graveyard." If the player 3 or more traps in their graveyard, they may choose whether or not to generate the effect to banish them. If they have 2 or fewer traps in their graveyard, they have no choice and the effect is not generated.
Example: Heave partially means "[...] you may pay {r}{r}{r} and put this face-up into your arsenal." If the player cannot pay the resource cost or they cannot put the card into their arsenal, they cannot choose to heave the card. The play must both pay the asset-cost and be able to put the card into their arsenal to be able to heave the card.
Example: Mark of the Huntsman has the text "When this hits a hero, you may choose to destroy this and mark them." Even if Mark of the Huntsman cannot be destroyed or the hero is already marked, the player may choose to generate the optional effects, in which case Mark of the Huntsman will be destroyed (if able) and the hero will be marked (if able).
1.8.4 A conditional effect is an effect that is dependent on a condition to be met. A conditional effect is typically written in the format "(If / During) [CONDITION], [EFFECT]," where CONDITION is the condition that must be met for the EFFECT to be generated/applied. If EFFECT is a list of two or more effects, each effect is a conditional effect with the same condition.
Note: Cards printed before 2022 have also used the format "If [EVENT and/or STATE] [EFFECTS]" to denote a triggered effect.[6.6]
1.8.4a A conditional effect, written in the format "Otherwise [EFFECT]," is an effect that is conditional on the opposite of a preceding conditional effect or the failure of a preceding effect. This effect's condition is met only when the preceding effect's condition is not met, or the preceding effect fails.
Example: Runeblood Incantation has the text "At the beginning of your action phase, remove a verse counter from Runeblood Incantation. If you do, create a Runechant token. Otherwise, destroy Runeblood Incantation," the latter part of which is a conditional discrete effect that is conditional on the failure to remove a verse counter from Runeblood Incantation.
1.8.4b A conditional effect, written in the format "[EFFECT] unless [OPPCONDITION]," is an effect that is conditional on the opposite of the OPPCONDITION. This effect's condition is only met when the OPPCONDITION is not met, or the OPPCONDITION is an effect that fails[1.8.9]. If the OPPCONDITION is an effect instead of a condition, it is an optional effect.
Note: An effect that reads "Deal 2 damage to the attacking hero unless they pay {r}." can be read as "The attacking hero may pay {r}. If they don't, deal 2 damage to them."
Example: Pitfall Trap has the text "Deal 2 damage to the attacking hero unless they pay {r}," which is a conditional discrete effect, that is conditional on the attacking hero not paying the asset-cost.
1.8.4c A conditional effect, written in the format "[EFFECT] while [CONDITION]," is an effect that only applies as long as CONDITION is met. The CONDITION is evaluated at all times while the effect exists. If the effect applies to one or more subjects, CONDITION is evaluated per subject.
Example: Parable of Humility has the text "Attack action cards controlled by an opposing hero have -1{p} while attacking and defending," which is a conditional static-continuous effect that applies to more than one object and a condition that is checked per object that it applies to.
1.8.5 A targeted effect is an effect where the target parameters are declared as the object, with the ability that generates it, is put onto the stack. Targeted effects always contain the phrase "target [DESCRIPTION]" or "[DESCRIPTION] (target/targets)" where DESCRIPTION is the specifics of one or more legal targets for the effect.
1.8.5a Only objects in the arena or on the stack are targetable (can be selected as a legal target), unless the effect specifies the legal target as a zone or an object that does not exist in the arena or on the stack.
Example: Memorial Ground (red) has the text "Put target attack action card with cost 2 or less from your graveyard on top of your deck." which describes a legal target as a card in the graveyard as opposed to a card in the arena or on the stack.
1.8.5b The same legal target cannot be declared more than once for any one instance of the target phrase.
1.8.5c An effect that specifies one or more subjects to affect, but does not use the term "target," is not a targeted effect. Non-target subjects do not need to be declared until the effect is generated.
Example: Remembrance has the text "Shuffle up to 3 action cards from your graveyard into your deck," which is not a targeted effect because it does not use the term "target" before the specified subjects of the effect.
1.8.5d If the DESCRIPTION of a legal target is "any," then the legal targets are dependent on the application of the effect. In this context, a legal target is any target that does not cause the effect to fail for the current game state.
1.8.5e If a targeted effect is optional, the player may choose not to select a target. If a player chooses not to select a target, the optional effect is not generated.
1.8.5f If an effect modifies the target of a targeted effect, only legal targets for the targeted effect may be selected as new targets, unless otherwise specified by the modifying effect. If there is no other legal target for the targeted effect, then the target remains unmodified.
Example: Taipanis, Dracai of Judgement has the text "The first time each turn another hero becomes the target of a source that would deal lethal damage, you may discard a red card. If you do, choose new targets for that source," which can modify the targets of an effect but can only select legal targets as per the original targeted effect. Taipanis cannot change the target of a hero's attack to be their own hero, because attacks can only target opposing living objects.
1.8.6 If the parameters of an effect are undetermined at the time the effect is generated, the player instructed by the effect determines the parameters of the effect. If no legal parameters exist, then any part of the effect related to those parameters fails.
Example: Remembrance has the text "Shuffle up to 3 action cards from your graveyard into your deck." This effect does not require targets when Remembrance is played on the stack, so when the effect is generated upon resolution, up to three action cards must be determined by the controlling player.
1.8.6a If two or more players are instructed to determine the parameters of an effect, those players determine the parameters in clockwise order, starting with the controller of the effect.[1.1.6]
Example: Codex of Frailty has the text "Each hero puts an attack action card from their graveyard face down into their arsenal," which requires all players to determine what card will be selected in their graveyard to be put into their arsenal. This starts with the player who controls Codex of Frailty as it resolves on the stack.
1.8.6b If the parameters of an effect include determining an object, the player can only determine objects that are public as parameters for the effect.[3.0.3]
Example: Oasis Respite has the text "Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to target hero this turn by a source of your choice," which has a parameter that can be any card or macro, as long as it is public (face-up).
1.8.6c If the parameters of an effect include determining two or more objects, but there are insufficient legal objects, all legal objects are consider the parameters of the effect.
Example: System Reset has the text "Banish X Mechanologist items you control [...]." If X is already determined to be 4, but there are only 3 legal items, all 3 of those items become the parameters to the banish effect.
1.8.6d If an effect would generate a compound event, the player determines the order of the individual events.[1.9.2]
Example: Tome of Imperial Flame has the text "[...] banish your hand." When the effect is generated, all the cards in the player's hand will be banished as a compound event and the player must choose the order each card is banished before the event occurs.
1.8.7 If an effect refers to the value of a property, it infers the existence of the property as well as its value. If an object does not have that property, it does not meet the condition of the existence of the property and thus the condition of the value of the property.
Example: Harmonized Kodachi has the text "While you have a card in your pitch zone with cost 0, [...]," which can be interpreted as "While you have a card in your pitch zone with the cost property and the value of that property is 0, [...]." This means a card without the cost property, such as Heart of Fyendal, will not satisfy the condition if it is in the pitch zone.
Example: Find Center has the text "Find Center can't be defended by cards with cost less than the number of chain links you control, [...],"  which can be interpreted as "Find Center cannot be defended by cards with the cost property, if the value of the cost property is less than the number of chain links you control, [...]." This means cards without the cost property, such as Ironrot Helm, would be able to defend the attack.
Example: Mutated Mass has the text "Mutated Mass's {p} and {d} are equal to twice the number of cards in your pitch zone with different costs," which can be interpreted as "Mutated Mass's {p} and {d} is equal to twice the number of cards in your pitch zone with the cost property, that have different costs." This means cards without the cost property, such as Heart of Fyendal, will not satisfy the condition (and be included in the calculation) if it is in the pitch zone.
1.8.7a If an effect requires the value of a numeric property from a specific object without that property, then zero is used as the value for the purpose of the effect.
Example: Ravenous Rabble has the text "Reveal the top card of your deck. Ravenous Rabble gets -X{p}, where X is the pitch value of the card revealed this way." If the revealed card for this effect was Gorganian Tome, which does not have the pitch property, the value of X would be zero.
1.8.8 If an effect instructs a player to perform an action "as though" the game state or rules were modified, or if an effect states an object or action "counts as" another object or action, rules and effects consider the modified game state or rules for the applicable effect only.
Example: Teklovossen, the Mechropotent has the text "This counts as having 4 Evos equipped." Effects that count the number of Evos a player has equipped would have their count increased by 4 due to this effect, but effects that apply to or interact directly with equipped Evos would not be affected.
1.8.9 An effect fails if the target(s) of the effect cease to exist, if there are no legal parameters at the time the effect is generated, or if all the events it creates fail to occur. If there are sufficient parameters to allow the effect to be generated, and at least one event does not fail to occur, the effect does not fail.
1.8.10 If an effect specifies "your next attack" but does not specify how the player gains control of the attack, it refers to the next attack that is played, activated, triggered, or otherwise comes under the player's control, and the effect applies to the attack at that time.
Example: Prismatic Leyline has the text "Your next red attack this turn gets +1{p}, your next yellow gets +2{p}, and your next blue gets +3{p}." If a player plays a red attack with stealth, it will get +1{p}. If the red attack is replaced with a blue attack using Uzuri's activated ability, the blue attack will get +3{p} as it is a new attack that comes under the player's control.
1.8.10a If an object has already been played, activated, or triggered, or otherwise has come under the player's control, and then the properties of that object change to become an attack as specified by the effect, the effect does not apply.
Example: Take Up the Mantle has the text "[...] you may banish an attack action card with stealth from your graveyard. If you do, the target becomes a copy of the banished card." If a player plays Prismatic Leyline, then a red attack with stealth, and finally Take Up the Mantle banishing a blue card, the attack will not get +3{p} from Prismatic Leyline as it was already under the control of the player and is not considered their next blue attack.
1.9 Events
1.9.1 An event is a change in the game state produced by the resolution of a layer, the result of an effect, a transition of turn phase or combat step, or an action taken by a player. An event may involve physically changing the game state through one or more instructions - it can be modified by replacement effects[6.4] and can trigger triggered effects[6.6].
1.9.1a If an event comprises an instruction that involves elements outside the game, that event cannot be modified by replacement effects or trigger triggered effects within the game, unless the event directly interacts with the game.
Example: Go Bananas has the text "Open and reveal a booster pack of Flesh and Blood and put all cards with the chosen name into your hand," which creates a 'reveal' event and a 'put' event as part of its resolution. The 'reveal' event only operates outside of the game, so any replacement effects and triggered effects within the game do not interact with it.  The 'put' event directly interacts with the game by putting an object into a game zone, so replacement effects and triggered effects within the game may interact with it.
1.9.1b If an event comprises an instruction to do nothing, the event does not occur. It cannot be modified by replacement effects and does not trigger effects.
Example: Blazing Aether has the text "Deal X arcane damage to target hero, where X is the amount of arcane damage you have dealt to that hero this turn." If the player has dealt 0 arcane damage this turn, the resolution of Blazing Aether produces an event that deals 0 arcane damage. Because dealing 0 arcane damage is an instruction to do nothing, it simply does not occur. It cannot be modified to deal more arcane damage by replacement effects, and it does not trigger effects for dealing arcane damage.
1.9.1c If an event comprises an instruction where failure cannot be verified by an opponent based on the current game state, that player may choose to fail to complete that instruction. If they do, the event simply fails as if that instruction cannot be completed.
Example: Moon Wish has the text "When this hits, search your deck for a card named Sun Kiss, [...]." The opponent cannot verify that a Sun Kiss is in the player's because the deck is private to the player, so the player may choose to fail to find a card named Sun Kiss even if there is one in their deck.
1.9.2 A compound event is an event that involves performing the same instructions more than once. An effect that produces a compound event is typically written in a compact format, where the effect specifies to repeat an instruction a number of times. When a compound event occurs, it is expanded, and the instructions occur as individual events.
Example: Tome of Harvests has the text "Draw 3 cards," which is an effect written in compact form, that produces a compound event that involves drawing a card three times. Each draw is performed as an individual event: draw a card, draw a card, draw a card.
1.9.2a If a triggered effect triggers from a compound event, it does not trigger again for any of the individual events of that compound event.
Example: Korshem, Crossroads of the Elements, has the text "Whenever a hero reveals 1 or more cards, [...]," which is a triggered effect that triggers on the compound event of revealing one or more cards, but does not then trigger on any of the individual events from that compound event.
1.9.2b If a replacement effect replaces a compound event, it cannot replace any of the individual events of that compound event.
Example: Mordred Tide has the text "Until end of turn, if you would create a Runechant token, instead create that many plus 1," which replaces the compound event that creates X Runechant tokens with a compound event that creates X+1 Runechant tokens. It does not then replace each of the X+1 individual "create a Runechant token" event with "create 2 Runechant tokens."
1.9.2c If an event involves two or more players performing an instruction, it is a compound event where each player performs that instruction in clockwise order as an individual event, starting with the turn player[1.1.6]. If the event was produced by an effect, each player performs that instruction starting with the controller of the effect instead.
Example: This Round's on Me has the text "Each hero draws a card," which when resolved produces a compound event that instructs each player to draw a card. This starts with the player who controls This Round's on Me as it resolves on the stack.
1.9.3 A composite event is an event that is made up of one or more internal events. An effect that produces a composite event typically uses an effect keyword.[8.5]
Example: Discard is a composite event that involves moving a card from a player's hand to their graveyard.
1.9.3a If a composite event occurs, and the composite event and/or internal event(s) would trigger the triggered effect, the triggered effect only triggers once on the composite event.
1.9.3b If a rule or effect prevents a triggered effect from triggering on a composite event and/or its internal event(s), then the triggered effect does not trigger on the composite event.
1.9.3c Replacement effects that partially modify internal events, do not modify the composite event that contains it, and therefore the composite event still occurs.
Example: Discard is a composite event that involves moving a card from the hand to the graveyard. If a replacement effect replaces the destination of the move event, then the discard event is still considered to occur.
1.9.3d If no internal events of a composite event occur, then the composite event is considered not to have occurred, and triggered effects that trigger on the composite event and/or internal event(s) do not trigger.
Example: Discard is a composite event that involves moving a card from the hand to the graveyard. If a replacement effect replaces the move event entirely, then the discard event is considered not to occur and abilities that trigger on discard are not triggered.
1.10 Game State
1.10.1 A game state is a moment in the game. The game transitions between states when an event occurs[1.9]. A priority state is a game state where a player would typically receive priority.
1.10.2 When the game transitions to a new priority state, the following game state actions are performed first:
1.10.2a First, if one or more heroes have died, their player loses the game (or the game ends in a draw).[4.5]
1.10.2b Second, if one or more living objects in the arena have 0 life total, they are cleared simultaneously as a single event. Living objects that cease to exist are considered to have died.[2.5.1][3.0.12]
1.10.2c Third, if a continuous effect allows a player to look at a card based on location, they may start looking at that card until it is no longer in that location.[8.5.11]
1.10.2d Forth, if the state-condition of a state-based triggered effect is met, the effect triggers. Then, if any triggered-layers have been created, but have not been added to the stack, they are added to the stack. If two or more triggered-layers have been created, then each player in clockwise-order adds their own triggered-layers to the stack, starting with a player chosen by the turn player.[6.6.6b]
1.10.2e Fifth and finally, if the combat chain is open and a rule or effect has closed the combat chain, the Close Step of combat begins.[7.7.2]
1.10.3 If a player makes an illegal action, or starts to make an action that becomes illegal to complete, the game state is reversed to the legal state before that action started.
1.10.3a Triggered effects do not trigger as a result of the action being reversed.
1.10.3b Replacement effects cannot replace any event as a result of the action being reversed.
1.10.3c If the game state cannot be reversed, as much as possible about the state is reversed and the game continues as though it were the last legal state before the reversal.
1.11 Priority
1.11.1 Priority is a game state concept that describes which player (if any), may play a card, activate an ability, or pass priority to the next player.
1.11.2 Only one player can have priority at any point in time. A player who has priority is the "active player." A player who does not have priority is an "inactive player."
1.11.3 The Action Phase is the only phase when players get priority. Within the action phase, players do not get priority during the Close Step of combat. At the beginning of the action phase, during most steps of combat, and after the resolution of a layer, the turn player gains priority.[4.2][7][5.3]
1.11.4 The active player may pass priority to the next player, referred to as "pass."
1.11.4a If a player passes, priority is given to the next player in clockwise order[1.1.6]. Typically, if all players pass in succession without playing any cards or activating any abilities, and the stack is not empty, the top layer of the stack resolves[5.3] - otherwise if the stack is empty, the phase or step ends[4][7].
1.11.5 If the active player plays a card or activates an ability, they regain priority after the card has been played or the ability has been activated[5.1.10]. If the active player passes, they lose priority until they receive it again from a rule. No player has priority while playing a card, activating an ability, resolving a layer, during a game process, and/or during game state actions.
1.12 Numbers and Symbols
1.12.1 Numbers are always integers.
1.12.1a If a rule or effect would calculate a fractional number and does not specify to round up or down, the number is rounded towards zero.
Example: An effect that would calculate the number 3.5 would be rounded down to 3, but the number -3.5 would be rounded up to -3.
1.12.1b If a rule or effect requires a player to choose a number, the number selected must be a non-negative integer - zero and above. If it requires the player to choose "up to" a number, the number selected must be between zero and the specified number, inclusive.
1.12.2 The letter X is used to represent a value that starts undefined and is defined later by a rule or effect.
1.12.2a If an object has a property with the value X, and the value of X undefined, the object is still considered to have that property and the value of X is evaluated to be zero.
1.12.2b If an object has a property with the value X, and the value of X is defined, it remains defined until the object ceases to exist.
1.12.2c If there are two or more undefined values in the same context, the letters Y and Z may also be used to represent those undefined values.
1.12.3 The asterisk symbol (c) is used to represent a value that is defined by a meta-static ability.
1.12.3a If an object has a property with the value (c) and the property-static ability cannot be used to define the value or there is no corresponding property-static ability, the object is still considered to have that property and the value of (c) is evaluated to be zero.
Example: Mutated Mass has an ability that defines its power and defense as double the total number of distinct costs of cards in the pitch zone. Outside of a game, this ability cannot be used to define the power and defense, so they are instead evaluated to be zero.
1.12.3b If an object has a property with the value (c) and the ability can be used to define the value, then (c) is evaluated according to the ability.
1.12.4 Symbols are typically used to represent the value of specified properties.[2]
1.12.4a The defense symbol is {d} and represents a defense value.
1.12.4b The intellect symbol is {i} and represents an intellect value.
1.12.4c The life symbol is {h} and represents a life value.
1.12.4d The power symbol is {p} and represents a power value. It is also used to refer to physical damage[8.5.3b].
1.12.4e The resource symbol is {r} and represents a resource value.
1.12.4f The chi symbol is {c} and represents a chi value.
1.13 Assets
1.13.1 An asset is a point of a given type, owned by a player. There are four types of assets: action points, resource points, life points, and chi points.
1.13.2 An action point is an asset that is typically used to play an action card and/or activate an action ability.
1.13.2a A player can gain action points during their action phase from the following: at the start of their action phase[4.3], the ability go again[8.3.5], and effects that grant the player action points.
1.13.2b A player cannot gain action points if it is not their action phase. If a player would gain an action point from a rule or effect but it is not their action phase, instead they do not gain any action points.
Lead the Charge has the text "The next time you play an action card with cost 0 or greater this turn, gain 1 action point. Go again." If a non-turn player played (as an instant) Lead the Charge (red), they would not gain an action point from the ability "go again." If they then played an action card with cost 0 (as an instant), they would not gain an action point from the delayed-triggered effect of Lead the Charge.
1.13.3 A resource point is an asset that is typically used to play cards and activate abilities.
1.13.3a A player can gain resource points from the following: pitching cards during the payment of an asset-cost that requires resource points[1.14.3], and effects that grant the player resource points.
1.13.4 A life point is an asset that is paid from a player's hero's life total and is typically used to activate abilities.
1.13.4a A player can gain life points from effects that increase the player's hero's life total.
1.13.5 A chi point is an asset that is typically used to play cards and activate abilities.
1.13.5a A player can gain chi points from the following: pitching cards during the payment of an asset-cost that requires chi or resource points[1.14.3].
1.13.5b A chi point can be used in place of a resource point for paying resource point costs.
1.14 Costs
1.14.1 A cost is the requirement of payment from a player incurred by playing a card, activating an ability, or resolving/applying an effect. A cost requires the payment of assets (asset-costs) and/or the successful resolution of effects (effect-costs).
1.14.2 An asset-cost is a cost that requires the payment of one or more assets[1.13]. To pay an asset-cost as a player, the player must have or gain assets of the appropriate type equal to, or greater than, the cost to be paid; then those the asset-cost amounts are subtracted from the player's assets and the cost is considered paid.
1.14.2a If an asset-cost involves paying two or more types of assets, they must be paid in the following order: chi points, resource points, life points, action points. Each type of asset must be paid in full before starting to pay for the next type.
1.14.2b If a player does not have enough assets and does not gain any additional assets to pay an asset-cost, the cost cannot be paid and the game state is reversed to before the cost is paid. If the asset-cost is mandatory and part of another action, the entire action is reversed.[1.10.3].
1.14.2c To pay a chi point cost, the player must use chi points[1.13.5]. If they have fewer chi points than required, the player may pitch cards[1.14.3] one at a time until they have enough chi points to pay the cost.
1.14.2d To pay a resource point cost, the player must use resource points and chi points[1.13.3][1.13.5]. If they have fewer resource points and chi points than required, the player may pitch cards[1.14.3] one at a time until they have enough resource points and chi points to pay the cost, then the cost is paid. The player must use all of their chi points before using any of their resource points to pay a resource point cost.
Example: A player has 1 resource point and plays a card with 3 cost (more than the number of resource points they have). If the player pitches a 3-pitch card, generating 3 resource points, they have finished paying the asset-cost of the card, have 1 resource point left over, and can no longer pitch cards because there are no more costs to pay. If the player pitches a 1-pitch card, generating 1 resource point, they still have 1 resource point left to pay and may continue pitching cards until the asset-cost is paid.
Example: A player plays a card with 2 cost and pitches a 1-pitch card, generating 1 resource point. The player then pitches a 3-pitch card, generating 3 chi points. Because they have enough resource and chi points to pay the cost, 2 chi points are used to pay the resource point cost first, and then they have 1 chi point and 1 resource point left over.
1.14.2e To pay a life point cost, the player must use life points[1.13.4].
1.14.2f To pay an action point cost, the player must use action points[1.13.2].
1.14.3 To pitch a card as a player, the player moves the card from their hand to the pitch zone and gains assets. The pitch property of a card determines what type and how many assets a player gains when the card is pitched[2.8].
1.14.3a A card cannot be pitched if it does not have the pitch property.
1.14.3b A player may only pitch a card if that card will gain them assets they need to pay an asset-cost or if they are instructed by an effect[8.5.44].
Example: If a player is paying an asset-cost of 3 chi points, they may only pitch cards that will gain them chi points when pitched. They cannot pitch cards that only gain them resource points.
1.14.3c Pitching a card is an event that can trigger and be replaced by effects.
1.14.4 An effect-cost is a cost that requires payment in the form of generating one or more effects. To pay an effect-cost, the player must be able to successfully generate and resolve the specified costs.
Hope Merchant's Hood has the text "Instant – Destroy Hope Merchant's Hood: Shuffle any number of cards from your hand into your deck, then draw that many cards," which is an activated ability with an effect-cost of destroying Hope Merchant's Hood.
1.14.4a If an effect-cost involves generating two or more effects, the player declares the order in which the effects will be generated.
1.14.4b Before the effect-cost is paid, if any of the effects cannot be generated due to a rule or effect, or the effects cannot resolve successfully based on the current game state, the cost cannot be paid and the game state is reversed to before the cost is paid. If the effect-cost is mandatory and part of another action, the entire action is reversed.[1.10.3].
1.14.4c During the payment of an effect-cost, if the events of any effects are replaced and cannot be successfully resolved, the cost is still considered paid.
1.14.5 A cost that is represented by "0," or a cost in which all asset-costs are reduced to zero and there are no effect-costs, is still considered a cost which is paid by acknowledging the zero cost.
1.15 Counters
1.15.1 A counter is a physical marker placed on any public object[3.0.3]. A counter is not an object and does not have properties. The identity of a counter is defined by its name, or its numerical value and symbol. Counters with the same name, or value and symbol, are functionally identical and interchangeable.
1.15.2 When a counter is on an object, it modifies its properties and/or interacts with effects.
1.15.2a A counter with a numerical value and symbol that corresponds to an object property modifies that property of the object it is on. This modification is considered a rule, not an effect, but does take place at the same time as continuous effects that modify the object in the same way.[6.3.2][6.3.3]
1.15.3 When an object ceases to exist, the counters on that object cease to exist[3.0.9]. When a counter is removed from an object it ceases to exist.
1.15.4 If a counter would be added to an object that has a diametrically opposing counter on it, both diametrically opposing counters remain on the object.
Example: If a -1{p} counter is placed on an object with a +1{p} counter on it, they both remain on the object. The counters do not cancel each other out and they are not removed from the object simply because they are diametrically opposing.
2 Object Properties
2.0 General
2.0.1 A property is an attribute of an object that defines how the object interacts with the rules and effects of the game. There are 13 properties an object may have: abilities[1.7], color strip, cost, defense, intellect, life, name, pitch, power, subtypes, supertypes, text box, and type.
2.0.1a An ability is a property, not an object. However, activated abilities have the object properties cost and type, for the purposes of rules and effects.
2.0.2 The properties of a card are defined by the information printed on the official Flesh and Blood card. If a property is not printed on the official Flesh and Blood card, the card it represents does not have that property.
2.0.2a If an errata has been published for a given card, the properties of that card are defined by the corrections in that errata. (See http://fabtcg.com/errata)
2.0.3 A numeric property is a property that has a numeric value. The value of some numeric properties can be modified by effects and/or counters to produce a modified value. The copyable value of the numeric property is typically the value that the object starts its existence with.
2.0.3a An effect that modifies the value of a numeric property does not modify the base value of that property unless otherwise specified by the effect.
Example: An effect that specifies an object to "gain," "get," "have," or "lose" a property-related value, modifies the value of the property but does not change the base value unless it specifically uses the term "base."
2.0.3b A numeric property is considered to have increased or decreased if a rule or effect is applied that causes an increase or decrease to its base or modified value[6.2.5].
Example: Korshem, Crossroads of the Elements has the text "[...], if [...] no card or token controlled by a hero has had {p} or {d} increased this turn, destroy Korshem, Crossroads of the Elements." If a player plays a card and an effect applies to the card that increases its power, a card controlled by a hero has had its power increased and Korshem will not be destroyed.
2.0.3c A numeric property cannot have a negative base or modified value. If one or more effects would set or reduce the base or modified value of a numeric property to be less than zero, instead they set or reduce it to zero.
2.0.3d A +1 or -1 property-related counter on an object, modifies the value of the property but does not change the base value.
2.0.4 An object is considered to have gained a property, or part of a property, if it did not have that property/part before, but currently does. An object is considered to have lost a property, or part of a property, if it had that property/part but currently does not.
2.0.5 The source of a property is the object of which the property is an attribute.
2.1 Color Strip
2.1.1 Color Strip is a visual representation of the printed pitch of a card.
2.1.2 The color strip of a card is typically located at the top of a card. The printed pitch of a card determines the color strip of the card. Cards with a printed pitch of 1, 2, and 3, typically have a color strip of red, yellow, and blue respectively. A card with no printed pitch typically does not have a color strip.
A card with a red color strip is considered red for the purposes of rules and effects.
A card with a yellow color strip is considered yellow for the purposes of rules and effects.
A card with a blue color strip is considered blue for the purposes of rules and effects.
2.1.3 If the base pitch or pitch of a card is modified, it does not modify the color strip of the card.
2.2 Cost
2.2.1 Cost is a numeric property of a card or ability, which determines the starting resource asset-cost to play the card or activate the ability.[5.1.6]
2.2.2 The printed cost of a card is typically expressed within a resource point symbol located in the top right corner of the card. The printed cost defines the base cost of a card. If a card does not have a printed cost, it does not have the cost property (0 is a valid printed cost).
2.2.2a If the printed value is expressed as two or more undefined symbols and/or numeric values, they are additive for determining the base cost of a card.
Example: Spark of Genius has the cost property with the printed value of "XX," which determines the base cost as X+X for any value of X.
2.2.3 The printed cost of an activated ability is expressed as {r} symbols as part of the description of the ability, where the number of {r} symbols dictates the printed cost. If there are no resource symbols, then the printed cost is 0. The printed cost defines the base resource cost of the ability.[5.2.1]
2.2.4 The cost property of an object cannot be modified.
2.2.4a An effect that increases or reduces the cost of an object does not modify the cost property of that object. Effects that modify cost are only applied as part of the process for playing or activating that object.[5.1.6]
Example: An effect that reduces the cost to play a card does not change the cost property of that card in any way - it only changes the calculation of the resource cost when that card is being played.
2.2.4b An effect that refers to the cost of an object refers to the unmodified cost property of an object. An effect that refers to the payment of an object, refers to the modified cost of an object when it was paid to play/activate and put that object on the stack.
2.2.5 The visual expression in {r} symbols and the numerical expression of cost are functionally identical.
Example: The text "Search your deck for a card with cost value 1," is considered to be the same as the text "Search your deck for a card with cost value {r}."
2.3 Defense
2.3.1 Defense is a numeric property of an object, which represents the value contributed to the total sum of defense used in the damage step of combat.[7.5]
2.3.2 The printed defense of a card is typically located at the bottom right corner of a card next to the {d} symbol. The printed defense defines the base defense of a card. If a card does not have a printed defense, it does not have the defense property (0 is a valid printed defense).
2.3.2a If the defense of a card is represented as a (c), then the card has an ability that defines the defense of the card at any point in or out of the game. If the ability requires a number that cannot be determined, the defense of the card is 0.
2.3.3 The defense of an object can be modified. The term "defense" or the symbol {d} refers to the modified defense of an object.
2.4 Intellect
2.4.1 Intellect is a numeric property of a hero card, which represents the number of cards the controlling player draws up to at the end of their turn.[4.4]
2.4.2 The printed intellect of a card is typically located at the bottom left corner of a card next to the {i} symbol. The printed intellect defines the base intellect of a card. If a card does not have a printed intellect, it does not have the intellect property (0 is a valid printed intellect).
2.4.3 The intellect of an object can be modified. The term "intellect" or the symbol {i} refers to the modified intellect of an object.
2.5 Life
2.5.1 Life is a numeric property of an object, which represents the starting life total of that object. An object with the life property is a living object.
2.5.2 The printed life of a card is typically located at the bottom right corner of a card next to the {h} symbol. The printed life defines the base life of a card. If a card does not have a printed life, it does not have the life property (0 is a valid printed life).
2.5.3 The life of an object can be modified. The term "life total" or the symbol {h} refers to the modified life of an object.
2.5.3a An object's life total is equal to the object's base life, plus life gained and minus life lost, as recorded by the players of the game.
2.5.3b Life gained and life lost are not continuous effects - they are discrete effects that apply once, and they permanently modify the life total.[8.5.7]
2.5.3c If the base life of an object changes, then the life total is recalculated using the new base life value of the object.
Example: Shiyana has 20 base life and the text "[...] Shiyana becomes a copy of target hero [...]." If Shiyana has lost 5 life and copies the target hero is Kano, with 15 base life, the new life total for Shiyana is 10.
2.5.3d An object's life total can be greater than its base life.
2.5.3e An object cannot have a negative life total. If the life total is calculated to be less than zero, instead it is considered zero.
2.5.3f If a living object's life total is reduced to zero, it is cleared as a game state action; or if the living object is a hero, their player loses or the game is a draw as a game state action.[1.10.2][4.5]
2.5.3g If a living object ceases to exist, it is considered to have died.
2.6 Metatype
2.6.1 Metatypes are a collection of metatype keywords. The metatypes of an object determine whether it may be added to a game.
2.6.2 An object can have zero or more metatypes.
2.6.3 The metatype of a card is determined by its type box. The metatype is printed before the card's supertypes.
2.6.4 The metatypes of an activated-layer or triggered-layer are the same as the metatypes of its source.
2.6.5 An object cannot gain or lose metatypes.
2.6.6 Metatypes are either hero-metatypes or set-metatypes. Hero-metatypes specify the moniker(s) of a hero, and the card can only be included in a player's card-pool if it matches their hero's moniker(s). Set-metatypes specify the the name(s) of the set the object can be used in as defined by tournament rules.
2.6.6a The set-metatypes are Rosetta.
Subtypes are either functional or non-functional keywords. Functional subtypes add additional rules to an object[8.2]. Non-functional subtypes do not add additional rules to an object.
2.7 Name
2.7.1 Name is a property of an object, which represents one of its object identities and determines the object's uniqueness (along with the pitch property).[1.2.2][1.3.4]
2.7.2 The printed name of a card is typically located at the top of the card. The printed name defines the name of a card.
2.7.3 If an object has a name that is a personal name, that name determines the object's moniker - the most significant identifier of the object's name. A personal name is typically written in the format "[HONORIFIC?] [MONIKER] [LAST?] [, SUFFIX?]," where HONORIFIC (if any) is one or more name honorifics, MONIKER is the moniker of the name, LAST (if any) is one or more middle and/or last names, and SUFFIX (if any) is a title or nickname written after a comma.
Example: The monikers of these names are as follows: Bravo (Bravo), Dorinthea Ironsong (Dorinthea), Data Doll MKII (Data Doll), Ser Boltyn, Breaker of Dawn (Boltyn), Blasmophet, the Soul Harvester, (Blasmophet), The Librarian (The Librarian), Dawnblade (Dawnblade), Stalagmite, Bastion of Isenloft (Stalagmite).
2.7.3a If an object does not have a name that is a personal name, it does not have a moniker.
2.7.3b If two objects have different names, they may have the same moniker. An effect that refers to an object using a moniker may refer to two or more objects with different names but the same moniker.
Example: The cards "Bravo," "Bravo, Showstopper," and "Bravo, Star of the Show," all have the moniker "Bravo."
2.7.3c A moniker is not considered a name. If an effect identifies an object by a name, it does not identify objects with a moniker that is the same as that name.
Example: If a player is instructed by an effect to name a card and they declare "Dawnblade," the effect identifies cards with the name "Dawnblade," but not cards with the name "Dawnblade, Resplendent" despite them having the moniker "Dawnblade."
2.7.4 An object's printed name is always considered to be the English language version of its name, regardless of the printed language.
2.7.5 A name or part of a name is equal to another name or part of a name only if it is an exact case-insensitive match.
Example: Censor has the text "When this hits a hero, name a card. They can't play the named card until the end of their next turn." If the named card is "Blazing Aether", the effect would not prevent the player from playing "Trailblazing Aether."
2.8 Pitch
2.8.1 Pitch is a property of a card, which represents the assets a player gains when they pitch the card. The pitch value of the card is the number of assets gained when pitched and it determines the object's uniqueness (along with the name property).[1.14.3][1.3.4]
2.8.2 The printed pitch of a card is expressed visually as one, two, or three socketed {r} or {c} symbols, typically located in the top left corner of a card, where the types of symbols dictate what asset is generated when pitched and the number of symbols dictates the printed pitch value. The printed pitch value defines the base pitch value of a card. If a card does not have a printed pitch value, it does not have the pitch property.
2.8.3 The pitch of an object can be modified. The term "pitch" refers to the modified pitch value of an object.
2.8.4 The visual expression of {r} or {c} symbols and the numerical expression of pitch are functionally identical.
Example: The text "Search your deck for a card with pitch value 1," is considered to be the same as the text "Search your deck for a card with pitch value {r}."
2.9 Power
2.9.1 Power is a numeric property of an object, which represents the power value used in the damage step of combat.[7.5]
2.9.2 The printed power of a card is typically located at the bottom left corner of a card next to the {p} symbol. The printed power defines the base power of a card. If a card does not have a printed power, it does not have the power property (0 is a valid printed power).
2.9.2a If the power value of a card is represented as a (c) then the card has an ability that defines the base power of the card at any point in or out of the game. If the ability requires a number that cannot be determined, the power of the card is 0.
2.9.3 The power of an object can be modified. The term "power" or the symbol {p} refers to the modified power of an object.
2.10 Subtypes
2.10.1 Subtypes are a collection of subtype keywords. The functional subtypes of a card determine what additional rules apply to the card.
2.10.2 An object can have zero or more subtypes.
2.10.3 The subtypes of a card are determined by its type box. Subtypes (if any) are printed after a long dash after the card's type.
2.10.4 The subtypes of an activated-layer or triggered-layer are the same as the subtypes of its source.
2.10.5 An object can gain or lose subtypes from rules and/or effects.
2.10.6 Subtypes are either functional or non-functional keywords. Functional subtypes add additional rules to an object[8.2]. Non-functional subtypes do not add additional rules to an object.
2.10.6a The functional subtype keywords are (1H), (2H), Affliction, Ally, Arrow, Ash, Attack, Aura, Construct, Figment, Invocation, Item, Landmark, and Quiver.[8.2]
2.10.6b The non-functional subtypes keywords are Angel, Arms, Axe, Base, Book, Bow, Brush, Chest, Chi, Claw, Club, Dagger, Demon, Dragon, Evo, Fiddle, Flail, Gem, Gun, Hammer, Head, Legs, Lute, Mercenary, Off-Hand, Orb, Pistol, Rock, Scepter, Scroll, Scythe, Shuriken, Song, Staff, Sword, Trap, Wrench, and Young.
2.11 Supertypes
2.11.1 Supertypes are a collection of supertype keywords. The supertypes of a card determine whether a card can be included in a player's card-pool.
2.11.2 An object can have zero or more supertypes.
2.11.3 The supertypes of a card are determined by its type box. Supertypes are printed before the card's type (if any).
2.11.4 The supertypes of an activated-layer or triggered-layer are the same as the supertypes of its source.
2.11.5 An object can gain or lose supertypes from rules and/or effects.
2.11.6 Supertypes are non-functional keywords and do not add additional rules to an object. A supertype is either a class or a talent.
2.11.6a The class supertype keywords are Adjudicator, Assassin, Bard, Brute, Guardian, Illusionist, Mechanologist, Merchant, Ninja, Ranger, Runeblade, Shapeshifter, Warrior, and Wizard.
2.11.6b The talent supertype keywords are Chaos, Draconic, Earth, Elemental, Ice, Light, Lightning, Mystic, Royal, and Shadow.
2.12 Text Box
2.12.1 The text box of a card contains the card text of a card, typically located on the lower half of a card beneath the illustration.
2.12.2 The card text of a card contains the rules text, reminder text, and flavor text of the card (if any). Rules text is printed in roman and boldface. Reminder text is printed in parenthesized italics. Flavor text is separated vertically from the rules and reminder text (if any) by a horizontal bar and is printed in italics.
2.12.3 The rules text of a card defines the base abilities of the card. A paragraph of rules text typically defines a single ability. Reminder and flavor text do not affect the game.
2.12.3a If the rules text specifies the name and/or moniker of its source object in the third-person it is a self-reference. A self-reference can be interpreted as "this" and it refers to its source object and not other cards with the same name.
2.12.3b If the rules text specifies the name and/or moniker of another object in the context of creating it, it refers to a hypothetical object with defined properties, including that name[8.6]. Otherwise, if the rules text specifies the name and/or moniker of another object it refers to any existing object with that name and/or moniker.
2.13 Traits
2.13.1 Trait is a property of an object, which represents one of its object identities.[1.2.2]
2.13.2 The printed traits of a card are typically located at the top of the card, under the card name. The printed traits define the traits of a card.
2.13.3 Traits are non-functional keywords or phrases and do not add additional rules to an object.
2.13.3a The trait keywords and phrases are Agents of Chaos.
2.13.4 If an effect refers to a group of cards by a trait, it refers to all cards with that trait.
Example: Arakni, Web of Deceit has the text "At the beginning of your end phase, if an opponent is marked, you become a random Agent of Chaos." This refers to a group which includes all cards with the Agent of Choas trait, and selecting one at random from that group.
2.14 Type Box
2.14.1 The type box of a card determines the card's metatypes, supertypes, types, and subtypes, typically located at the bottom of the card. Type boxes are typically written in the format "[METATYPES] [SUPERTYPES] [TYPE] [--- SUBTYPES]," where METATYPES is zero or more metatypes, SUPERTYPES is zero or more supertypes, TYPE is zero or more types, and SUBTYPES is zero or more subtypes.
2.14.1a If the SUPERTYPES of a type box is "Generic," the card has no supertypes.
2.14.1b Hybrid cards are cards with SUPERTYPES written in the format "[SUPERTYPES-1] / [SUPERTYPES-2]." A hybrid card can be included in a player's card-pool as though it only has one of the supertypes sets, SUPERTYPES-1 or SUPERTYPES-2, not both[1.1.3]. Otherwise, hybrid cards have all of the supertypes specified by SUPERTYPES-1 and SUPERTYPES-2.
2.15 Types
2.15.1 Types are a collection of type keywords. The types of a card determine whether the card is a hero-, token-, deck-, or arena-card, and how a deck-card may be played.
2.15.2 An object can have zero or more types.
2.15.3 The type of a card is determined by its type box. The type is printed after the card's supertypes, and before a long dash and subtypes (if any).
2.15.4 The types of an activated-layer or triggered-layer are the same as the types of its source.
2.15.4a The types of an activated ability layer include the types determined by the activated ability.[5.2.1]
2.15.5 An object can gain or lose types from rules and/or effects.
2.15.6 Types are functional keywords and add additional rules to an object.[2.15]
2.15.6a The type keywords are Action, Attack Reaction, Block, Defense Reaction, Demi-Hero, Equipment, Hero, Instant, Macro, Mentor, Resource, Token, and Weapon.[8.1]
3 Zones
3.0 General
3.0.1 A zone is a collection of objects. There are 15 types of zones: arms, arsenal, banished, chest, combat chain, deck, graveyard, hand, head, hero, legs, permanent, pitch, stack, and weapon.
3.0.1a A zone is considered empty when it does not contain any objects and has no permanents equipped to it. An equipment zone is exposed if it is empty. A zone does not cease to exist if it is empty.
3.0.2 Each player has their own arms, arsenal, banished, chest, deck, graveyard, hand, head, hero, legs, and pitch zones; and has two weapon zones. The stack zone, permanent zone, and combat chain zone are shared by all players.
Note: Cards printed before 2023 have used the phrase "zone you control" which refers to a zone that the player owns.
3.0.3 An object can have one of two possible states of visibility: public, or private. A public object is an object where information about the properties of the object is currently available to all players. A private object is an object where the information about the properties of that object is not currently available to all players.
3.0.3a A player may look at any private object they own, or is in a zone that they own, unless the object is in the deck zone.
3.0.4 A public zone is a zone in which the default visibility of objects is public. A private zone is a zone in which the default visibility of objects is private.
3.0.4a The arms, banished, chest, combat chain, graveyard, head, hero, legs, permanent, pitch, stack, and weapon zones are public zones.
3.0.4b The arsenal, deck, and hand zones are private zones.
3.0.4c A public zone may contain a private object, if the object is made private while in that zone, or if the object is moved into that zone as a private object. The private object remains private until a rule or effect makes it public.
3.0.4d A private zone may contain public objects if the object is made public while in that zone, or if the object is moved into that zone as a public object. The public object remains public until a rule or effect makes it private.
3.0.4e If a rule or effect specifies an object in a public zone, the source must be public for the rule or effect to apply unless otherwise stated.
Example: Tome of Torment has the text "You may play Tome of Torment from your banished zone." If a Tome of Torment is private (face-down) in the banished zone, a public zone, its ability would not apply because it does not explicitly state face-down.
3.0.5 The arena is a collection of all the arms, chest, combat chain, head, hero, legs, permanent, and weapon zones.
3.0.5a The arena is not a zone. If an object would be put into the arena by a rule or effect without specifying a zone, it is placed into the permanent zone as a permanent.
3.0.5b The arsenal, banished, deck, graveyard, hand, pitch, and stack zones are not part of the arena.
3.0.6 The layout and representation of zones and objects in those zones are defined by tournament rules.
3.0.7 When an object moves from one zone to another, the object leaving its old zone (origin) and the object entering its new zone (destination) is performed simultaneously. At no point is the object not in a zone.
3.0.7a The object as it leaves the origin is considered the object moving for rules and effects. If the object is private when it moves zones, it is considered to have no properties for effects.
Example: Levia has the text "While a card with 6 or more {p} has been put into your banished zone this turn, [...]," which is a while-conditional static effect. If a card is banished and it has 4 {p} as it leaves its origin, but 6 {p} when it enters the banished zone, it does not meet the condition of the effect. If a card is banished and it is private as it leaves its origin, it does not meet the condition of the effect.
3.0.7b If the origin and the destination of a move are the same, then no move occurs. If the object would go from public to private during the move, it just becomes private instead. If the object would go from private to public during the move, it just becomes public instead.
Example: Mark of the Beast has the text "If this would be put into your graveyard from anywhere, instead banish it." If Mark of the Beast is banished face-down, and then an effect tries to put it into the graveyard, it will become face-up and remain in the banished zone. It is still considered the same card as before.
3.0.8 If a private object will move zones and be public at the destination, it becomes public before it is moved. If a public object will move zones and be private at the destination, it becomes private before it is moved.
Example: Azalea's activated ability puts a card from the deck (private object) into the arsenal face-up (public object in a private zone), therefore it becomes public before it is moved.
Example: Intimidate puts a card from hand (private object) into the banished zone face down (private object in a public zone), therefore it does not become public before it is moved.
3.0.8a If the destination of an object is replaced after the object becomes public, then [3.0.8] is re-evaluated based on whether it will be a public or private object at the new destination.
Example: Drone of Brutality has the text "If Drone of Brutality would be put into your graveyard from anywhere, instead put it on the bottom of your deck." If Drone of Brutality is discarded (from the private hand zone to the public graveyard zone), the card first becomes a public object, then the replacement effect replaces the destination to be the deck (a private zone), the card becomes a private object, and finally, the cards are moved to the bottom of the deck.
3.0.9 If an object enters a zone that is not in the arena and is not the stack zone, or a public object becomes a private object, it resets - its previous existence ceases to exist and it becomes a new object with no relation to its previous existence.
Example: Endless Arrow is played and during the reaction step, Snapdragon Scalers is activated to give it "go again." Endless Arrow hits and returns to the player's hand (a zone outside the arena) and therefore becomes a new object. If the player plays Endless Arrow again it will not have "go again" because it is a new Endless Arrow card with no relation to its previous existence.
3.0.9a An ability that triggers when an object moves from one zone to another still references the new object, as long as the object remains a public object.
Example: Merciful Retribution has the text "Whenever an aura or attack action card you control is destroyed, [...] If it's a non-token Light card, put it into your hero's soul." If a non-token Light card in the arena is destroyed, it moves to the graveyard and becomes a new object. However, because Merciful Retribution triggers on the object moving to the graveyard (as part of its destruction) it still references the new object it becomes in that zone for the triggered-layer it produces. If the non-token Light card moves to another zone or becomes private before the layer resolves, the triggered-layer loses that reference.
3.0.9b An ability with an effect that moves an object from one zone to another still references the new object for the remainder of any effects it generates, as long as the object remains a public object.
Example: Bull's Eye Bracers has the text "If you have no cards in your arsenal, you may put an arrow card from your hand face up into your arsenal. It gains +1{p} until end of turn." If an arrow card is put into the arsenal, it becomes a new object. However, because the activated ability of Bull's Eye Bracers was the source of the effect that moved the arrow card, the rest of the effect still references the new object it became in that zone.
3.0.9c The process of how an object becomes a new object is preserved as the history of that new object.
Example: Slithering Shadowpede has the text "If this was banished from your hand this turn, you may play it from your banished zone." If Slithering Shadowpede is banished from hand, it resets and becomes a new object in the banished zone, but the information regarding where it was banished from is preserved, allowing it to be played from the banished zone this turn.
3.0.10 Zones of the same type are independent of their creation method. If a rule or effect creates a zone of the same type as an existing zone, the created zone is not distinguishable as being created by that rule or effect - only that there is now an additional zone of that type.
3.0.10a If a rule or effect moves an object into a specified type of zone, and there are two or more zones that match the specified type, the player that owns the object chooses which zone that object is moved to.
3.0.10b If the zone of a player ceases to exist, and there is only one of that type of zone owned by the player, any cards in that zone are cleared and the zone ceases to exist.
3.0.10c If the zone of a player ceases to exist, and there are two or more of that type of zone owned by the player, an empty zone of that type owned by the player ceases to exist. If there are no zones of that type owned by the player that are empty, the player chooses which zone will cease to exist - any cards in that zone are cleared and the zone ceases to exist.
3.0.11 If a rule would move an object to a zone that does not exist, or the zone cannot contain that object, the object is cleared instead[3.0.12]. If an effect would move an object to a zone that does not exist, or the zone cannot contain that object, and the object would not cease to exist from another rule or effect, then the move event fails.
Example: Uzuri has the text "[...] put target attacking card with stealth from the active chain link on the bottom of its owner's deck [...]" If the target attacking card with stealth has the token type, it ceases to exist before it is put on the bottom of the deck.
3.0.12 To clear an object, move it from its current zone to its owner's graveyard.
3.0.12a If the object is a token, macro, or a non-card-layer, it leaves its current zone and simply ceases to exist.
3.0.13 If an effect refers to one or more zones without specifying the owner of those zones (or specifying "any"), it refers to the zones owned by the controller of the effect.
3.0.14 A sub-card is a card that is under a permanent, or a card on the stack. A top-card is the card on top, and the sub-card is underneath.
3.0.14a A card is only considered to be under a permanent if specified by a rule or effect.
3.0.14b A sub-card is not considered to be in the arena, even if its top-card is in the arena. If a card becomes a sub-card, it ceases to exist and becomes a new card with no relation to its previous existence[3.0.9].
3.0.14c If a top-card moves zones and remains the same object, its sub-cards move to the same zone as part of the same event and remain sub-cards. If a top-card becomes a sub-card of another permanent, all of its sub-cards also become sub-cards of that permanent.
3.0.14d If the top-card is public, all sub-cards are also public. If a top-card is private, all sub-cards are also private.
3.0.14e If a top-card ceases to exist, its sub-cards are cleared as part of the same event.[3.0.12]

4 Game Structure
4.0 General
4.0.1 A game of Flesh and Blood is preceded by the start-of-game procedure and ends when a player wins or the game is a draw.[4.1][4.5]
4.0.2 A match consists of one or more consecutive games between the same players with the same decks.
4.0.3 A turn is a game state concept that structures the order of play and phases.
4.0.3a A turn consists of 3 phases in order: Start Phase, Action Phase, and End Phase.
4.0.3b Only one player can have a turn at any point in time. A player whose turn it is is the "turn player." A player whose turn it is not is a "non-turn player."
4.1 Starting a Game
4.1.1 The process of starting a game is referred to as the start-of-game procedure. Players do not get priority during the start-of-game procedure.
4.1.2 First, each player places their hero card face up in their hero zone.
4.1.3 Second, a player is selected and chooses the first-turn player. If it is the first game of a match, one of the players is selected using a random method that is mutually agreeable. If it is not the first game of a match, the player who lost first in the previous game of the match is the selected player; or if the previous game ended in a draw, the selected player is the same as in the previous game. The select player then chooses any player to be the first-turn player.
4.1.4 Third, each player selects arena-cards from their card-pool that they will start the game with.[1.3.2d]
4.1.4a A player may select up to one arena-card for each of their arms, chest, head, legs, and weapon zones. Each card will start the game equipped in its respective zone, based on its type and/or subtype.[4.1.8]
4.1.4b Cards selected this way are placed face-down in their respective zones or in a single face-down pile next to the hero. These cards and their number are private to each player until the game begins.
4.1.5 Fourth, each player selects the deck-cards from their card-pool that will become their deck.
4.1.5a Arena-cards cannot be included in a player's deck.
4.1.5b If a meta-static ability effect allows the player to start the game with one or more cards in a zone other than their deck, these cards are selected from their deck and placed face-down in their respective zones or in the single face-down pile next to the hero. The cards selected this way are still considered part of the player's deck. These cards and their number are private to each player until the game begins.
Example: Dash has the text "You may start the game with a Mechanologist item with cost {r}{r} or less in the arena," which means if the game format requires a starting deck of 40 cards, the player may select the specified from those 40 cards, and start the game with 1 card in the arena and 39 cards in their deck zone.
4.1.6 Fifth, all other cards in a player's card-pool that were not selected during [4.1.4] or [4.1.5] become that player's inventory.
4.1.6a An inventory is a defined collection of cards in the game - it is not a zone.
4.1.6b An inventory is private. Players may look at cards in their own inventory during a game but are not required to show any other player.
4.1.6c If one or more cards remaining in the player's card-pool fail to meet the specifications of a rule or effect at the start of the game, those cards are removed from the game and are not considered part of the inventory for the game.
Example: Taylor has the text "Each equipment in your starting inventory must have a different name," which means if there are two or more cards with the same name remaining in the player's card-pool, the first one is included in the player's inventory and the second one is removed from the game.
4.1.7 Sixth, each player shuffles and presents their starting deck to an opponent to be shuffled and/or cut.
4.1.7a After a player has presented their starting deck to be shuffled and/or cut, it is placed in their deck zone and they may no longer change any cards they have chosen in [4.1.4][4.1.5].
4.1.7b A starting deck is private to each player. The opponent may not look at the information of the cards in a deck presented to them.
4.1.8 Seventh, each player in clockwise order equips their respective weapons and equipment, starting with the first turn player [1.1.6][8.5.41]. Any other cards that start the game in a zone other than the deck zone are put in their respective zones. The "start of the game" event occurs and effects that trigger at the start of the game are triggered. Layers on the stack resolve and game state actions are performed as if all players are passing priority in succession until the stack is empty[1.10.2].
4.1.8a If two or more triggered-layers are created, they are added to the stack in an order chosen by the first-turn player.[6.6.6b]
4.1.8b If an effect would only trigger during a player's turn, it does not trigger during the start-of-game procedure.
Example: Victor has the text "The first time each turn you create a Gold token from an effect you control, draw a card." If a player creates a Gold token from an effect they control during the start-of-game procedure, Victor's effect will not trigger because it is not during a player's turn.
4.1.9 Eighth and finally, each player draws cards up to their hero's intellect and the first turn player begins their Start Phase.
4.2 Start Phase
4.2.1 Players do not get priority during the Start Phase.
4.2.2 First, the turn starts. Effects that last until the "start of turn" end. The "start of turn" event occurs and effects that trigger at the start of turn are triggered. Layers on the stack resolve and game state actions are performed as if all players are passing priority in succession until the stack is empty[1.10.2].
4.2.3 Second and finally, the Start Phase ends and the game proceeds to the action phase.
4.3 Action Phase
4.3.1 First, the action phase starts. The "beginning of the action phase" event occurs and effects that trigger at the beginning of the action phase are triggered.
4.3.2 Second, the turn player has 1 action point.
4.3.2a Effects that trigger when a player gains an action point do not trigger when the turn player gains an action point this way.
4.3.2b Replacement effects that modify events when a player gains an action point do not modify or replace when the turn player gains an action point this way.
4.3.3 Third, the turn player gains priority.
4.3.4 Fourth and finally, when the stack is empty, the combat chain is closed, and both players pass priority in succession, the action phase ends and the game proceeds to the End Phase.
4.4 End Phase
4.4.1 Players do not get priority during the End Phase.
4.4.2 First, the "beginning of the end phase" event occurs and effects that trigger at the beginning of the end phase are triggered. Layers on the stack resolve and game state actions are performed as if all players are passing priority in succession until the stack is empty.[1.10.2].
4.4.3 Second, the end-of-turn procedure occurs. After each step in the end-of-turn procedure, if a triggered effect has triggered, the triggered-layers are added to the stack; then layers on the stack resolve and game state actions are performed as if all players are passing priority in succession until the stack is empty. The end-of-turn procedure happens in the following order:
4.4.3a All allies' life totals are reset to their base life, modified by any counters on the object.
4.4.3b The turn player may put a card from their hand face-down into an empty arsenal zone they own.
4.4.3c Each player puts all cards in their pitch zone (if any) on the bottom of their deck in any order. The order cards are put on the bottom of the deck this way is hidden information.
4.4.3d All players lose all action points and resource points.
4.4.3e The turn player draws cards until the number of cards in their hand is equal to their hero's intellect {i}. If it is the first turn of the game, all other players draw cards until the number of cards in their hand is equal to their hero's intellect {i}. If a player already has at least that many cards in their hand, they do not draw any cards this way.[8.5.6]
4.4.4 Third and finally, the turn ends. Effects that last until the "until end of turn" and "this turn" end. The next player in clockwise order becomes the new turn player[1.1.6]. The new turn player begins their Start Phase.
4.5 Ending a Game
4.5.1 A game ends immediately when a player wins, or the game is a draw.
4.5.1a If a player loses a game, and the game does not end, all objects the player controls are cleared, and then all objects owned by the player are removed from the game. The player and their hero cease to exist for the remainder of the game. Layer-continuous effects controlled by the player continue to exist until they expire.
Example: A player controls an attack action card on the combat chain and a triggered-layer on the stack. An opponent controls a Frostbite (a token-card) and a Frost Hex (a deck-card) owned by the player. If the player loses the game at this point, the attack is cleared to their graveyard and the triggered-layer ceases to exist on the stack, and then everything the player owns (including the Frostbite and Frost Hex) are removed from the game.
4.5.2 A player can win the game in the following ways:
4.5.2a A player wins the game if all of their opponents have lost the game.
4.5.2b A player wins the game if an effect states that they win the game.
4.5.3 A player can lose the game in the following ways:
4.5.3a A player loses the game if their hero's life total is reduced to zero or they do not control a hero.
4.5.3b A player loses the game if an effect states that they lose the game.
4.5.3c A player loses the game if they concede.
4.5.4 The game can be a draw for the remaining players in the following ways:
4.5.4a The game is a draw for the remaining players if all remaining players' hero's life totals are simultaneously reduced to zero.
Example: There are 2 remaining players. One player plays and resolves Forked Lightning, targeting both themselves and their opponent. Neither player prevents any arcane damage and both their life totals are simultaneously reduced to zero, resulting in a draw.
4.5.4b The game is a draw for the remaining players if an effect states that the game is a draw.
4.5.4c The game is a draw for the remaining players if all remaining players agree to an intentional draw. The remaining players can agree to a draw at any time.
4.5.4d The game is a draw for the remaining players if a stalemate occurs. A stalemate happens when no remaining player can legally advance the game state toward ending the game.
Example: There are 2 remaining players. Both players only have a Cracked Bauble in their hand, no cards in the arena, or cards in their deck, arsenal, or banished zone. Both players control a weapon without an attack ability or an ability that would reduce life totals, so they have no way of advancing the game state to a conclusion. Therefore the game ends in a draw because both players are stalemated.
4.5.4e The game is a draw for the remaining players if a deadlock occurs. A deadlock happens when all remaining players refuse to legally advance the game state toward ending the game.
Example: There are 2 remaining players on 1 life total. Both players only have Invert Existence and a Cracked Bauble in their hand, no equipment, weapon, or cards in their deck, arsenal, or banished zone. The first person to play Invert Existence will lose the game because the opposing player can respond with their Invert Existence which will resolve first and give them the win. Therefore the game ends in a draw because both players are deadlocked.
5 Layers, Cards, & Abilities
5.0 General
5.1 Playing Cards
5.1.1 To play a card is to move it to the stack as a card-layer[1.6.2a]. Only a card's owner can play it unless otherwise specified by a rule or effect. Playing a card involves the following steps in order: Announce, Declare Costs, Declare Modes and Targets, Check Legal Play, Calculate Asset-Costs, Pay Asset-Costs, Calculate Effect-Costs, Pay Effect-Costs, and Play.
5.1.1a A player can only play cards from their hand or arsenal zones unless otherwise specified by a rule or effect.
5.1.2 Announce: First, the player proposes the card to be played. The card moves to the stack zone under that player's control and becomes the topmost layer of the stack.
5.1.2a Effects that apply to the next card played are applied if the card matches the effect description. Effects that are dependent on any undetermined parameters of the card are applied when those parameters are declared.
Example: There are three continuous effects active: "The next attack action card you play gains +3{p}," "Action cards cost {r} less to play," and "Attack action cards you control have +3{p}." When an attack action card is proposed to be played and is moved to the stack under the player's control, all three effects begin to apply immediately.
Example: Goliath Gauntlet has the text "The next attack action card with cost 2 or greater you play this turn gets +2{p}." If you play an attack action card with a cost of X, at the time you declare the value of X to be 2 or more, Goliath Gauntlet's effect will apply. If you declare X to be 0 or 1, Goliath Gauntlet will not apply.
5.1.2b A card may only be announced to be played if a rule or existing effect allows it to be played.
Example: Tome of Torment has the text "You may play Tome of Torment from your banished zone." which is a play-static ability that when functional, allows it to be played from the banished zone. If Tome of Torment is private (face-down) in the banished zone, its play-static ability is not functional and therefore it cannot be announced to be played.
5.1.2c If the card is a split-card, the player declares which side the split-card will be played with[9.2.3]. If the split-card has meld[8.3.38] the player may declare that the card is played with both sides. The declared side(s) determines the card's properties when put onto the stack and any subsequent effects applied to it.
Example: A player may play Null||Shock by declaring one of its sides (Null or Shock), or by declaring both sides using meld. Doing so determines the name, types, and abilities of the card on the stack until it ceases to exist.
5.1.3 Declare Costs: Second, the player declares the parameters for any costs of the proposed card.
5.1.3a If the card has a variable cost that includes X, the player must declare the value of X[1.12.2]. If the player uses an effect to play the card without paying the cost that includes X, then the player must declare X as 0.
5.1.3b If the card has additional costs that are optional, the player must declare all additional costs that will be paid.
5.1.3c If the card has an alternative cost or an effect that allows the player to play the card without paying the cost, the player must declare if the alternative cost will be paid or the effect will be used. If a card has two or more alternative costs and/or effects that allow the player to play the card without paying the cost, the player may only declare one (if any) of these.
5.1.3d If the card has the type action and it may be played as an instant, the player declares whether or not they are playing the card as an instant.
5.1.3e If there are two or more effect-costs to be paid, the player declares the order those costs will be paid.
5.1.4 Declare Modes and Targets: Third, the player declares the parameters of all resolution abilities.
5.1.4a If the card has any modal resolution abilities, the player must declare the modes for those abilities[1.7.5]. Then, if any resolution abilities generate effects that require a target, the player must declare all legal targets for those effects[1.8.5].
5.1.4b If the card is an attack, the player must declare the target(s) of the attack[1.4.5].
5.1.5 Check Legal Play: Fourth, the card is evaluated if it is legal to play before any costs are paid. If a rule or effect prevents the card from being played, or the parameters of the proposed card are illegal, the card is illegal to play and the game state is reversed to before the card was announced.[1.10.3]
5.1.6 Calculate Asset-Costs: Fifth, all asset-costs of the proposed card are calculated.[1.13]
5.1.6a First, rules define the starting asset-cost. Second, effects that set an asset-cost are applied. Third, effects that increase an asset-cost are applied. Fourth and finally, effects that reduce an asset-cost are applied - if an effect would reduce an asset-cost to be less than zero, it instead reduces it to zero. If two or more effects are applied at each step, then they are applied in timestamp order[6.3.4].
5.1.6b The action asset-cost starts at zero. If the card has the type action and is not played as an instant, the action cost starts at one instead.
5.1.6c The resource asset-cost starts at the base resource cost of a card being played. If an alternative cost is declared that replaces the resource asset-cost for playing the card, then the resource asset-cost starts at zero instead.
5.1.7 Pay Asset-Costs: Sixth, the player pays all asset-costs (if any).[1.14.2]
5.1.7a If any asset-cost is not paid in full, the card is illegal to play and the game state is reversed to before the card is announced.[1.10.3]
5.1.8 Calculate Effect-Costs: Seventh, all effect-costs of the proposed cards are calculated.
5.1.8a If any effect-cost cannot be paid, based on the order declared by the player, the card is illegal to play and the game state is reversed to before the card was announced.[1.10.3]
5.1.9 Pay Effect-Costs: Eighth, the player pays all effect-costs.
5.1.9a If a replacement effect modifies an effect-cost, and that cost cannot be paid (the effect does not resolve successfully), the card can still be played.
5.1.10 Play: Ninth and finally, the card is now considered played and the player regains priority.
5.2 Activated Abilities
5.2.1 An activated ability is an ability that can be activated to put an activated-layer on the stack. Activated abilities are always written in the format "[LIMIT?] [TYPE] -- [COST]: [ABILITIES] [CONDITION?]."
5.2.1a The LIMIT (if any) is written at the start of the ability and specifies the maximum number of times the ability can be activated. If there is no limit, the ability can be activated any number of times.
5.2.1b The TYPE is written directly before the hyphen and specifies the type of the ability and the type of the activated-layer created by activating the ability.
5.2.1c The COST is written between the dash and colon. It specifies the cost to be paid to activate the ability. A cost of "0" specifies the resource cost to activate the ability is zero.
5.2.1d The ABILITIES are written after the colon and specify the base abilities of the activated-layer. When the activated-layer resolves, the resolution abilities of the layer generate effects.
5.2.1e The CONDITION (if any) is written at the end of the ability and specifies the activation condition. If the activated ability has an activation condition and that condition is not met, the ability cannot be activated.
5.2.2 To activate an activated ability is to create an activated-layer on the stack. A player can only activate an activated ability if they have priority, the ability is functional[1.7.4], and the player controls its source (or owns its source if there is no controller), unless otherwise specified by a rule or effect. Activating an activated ability involves the following:
5.2.2a Announce the activated ability to be activated. The activated-layer is created in the stack zone under that player's control and becomes the topmost layer of the stack. The activated-layer is created with the same supertypes and types as the source of the activated ability. Continuous effects begin to apply to the ability layer.
5.2.2b The remainder of the process for activating an activated ability is identical to the process for playing a card listed in steps [5.1.3]-[5.1.10], substituting "play" for 'activate`, and "card" for "ability."
5.2.3 If an effect allows an ability to be activated additional times, that activated ability may be activated to exceed its LIMIT by the specified amount of times.
5.2.3a If an effect allows all abilities on an object to be activated additional times and the object has two or more activated abilities, each activated ability of that object can be activated additional times.
Example: Snap Shot has the text "[...] you may activate abilities of bows you control an additional time this turn and as though they were an instant," which allows each individual activated ability on bows the player controls to be activated an additional time.
5.2.3b If an effect allows an object to be activated additional times and the object has two or more activated abilities, the effect applies at the time the ability is activated beyond its LIMIT. The total number of additional activations may be spread across all activated abilities on the object.
Example: Tri-shot has the text "You may activate target bow you control 2 additional times this turn," which allows the activated abilities on the target bow to be activated a combined total of 2 additional times.
5.2.3c If an effect allows a source to attack additional times, it refers to activating an ability on the source with the attack ability ([8.3.1]) or attack effect ([8.5.38]).
Example: Twinning Blade has the text "You may attack an additional time with target sword this turn," which allows the player to activate an activated ability (with the attack ability/effect) on the target sword an additional time past its LIMIT.
5.2.3d Effects that allow the additional activation of an activated ability are additive. If two or more effects would allow an activated ability to be activated beyond its LIMIT, the player chooses which of those effects apply to the activation.
5.2.3e Effects that state how many times an ability can be activated in total, set the LIMIT of the activated ability (or the total number of times that all activated abilities), which can be surpassed by effects that allow the ability to be activated additional times.
Example: Blood on Her Hands has the text "[...] Target 1H weapon may attack twice this turn," which is an effect that sets the total number of times an activated ability (with the attack effect) can be activated on the target to two. If this effect is applied two or more times, the activated ability (with the attack effect) can still only be activated twice.
5.2.4 If an activated ability's cost can only be paid when the source is private, or if its activation condition specifies the privacy status and/or zone of its source, the ability is functional when the source meets that requirement.
5.2.4a If an activated ability is functional, but its source has no controller, then the owner may activate the ability instead.
Example: Vigorous Windup has the text "Instant -- Discard this: Create a Vigor token." This ability is functional while the card is in its owner's hand. The owner may activate the ability despite not controlling the source.
5.2.4b If a player activates an ability of a private source, the source of the ability becomes public until either the activated-layer resolves or ceases to exist, or the source ceases to exist. When an object becomes public this way, it does not trigger any abilities and cannot be replaced by any replacement effects.
5.3 Resolution Abilities & Resolving Layers
5.3.1 A resolution ability is an ability that generates effects when its source resolves as a layer on the stack. If the stack is not empty and all players pass in succession, the top layer of the stack resolves, except the Layer Step of combat [7.1]. When a layer resolves it does so in the following order: Check resolution, Static effects, Layer effects, Go again, Leave stack, Clear.
5.3.2 Check resolution: First, whether the layer fails to resolve is evaluated. If a layer fails to resolve, the resolution stops, the layer is cleared from the stack, and the turn player gains priority. A layer fails to resolve in the following situations:
5.3.2a If the layer has a resolution ability with a targeted effect, and one or more targets were declared when the layer was put onto the stack, at least one of those targets must still be a legal target - otherwise, the layer fails to resolve.
5.3.2b If the layer is a triggered-layer created by a triggered effect with a state-trigger condition, the state-trigger condition must be met by the current game state - otherwise, the layer fails to resolve.
Example: An attack with phantasm is defended by an attack action card with 6{p}. Before the phantasm triggered-layer effect resolves, the attacking hero plays Blinding Beam, giving the defending card -2{p}. When the phantasm triggered-layer resolves, the game state condition that caused phantasm to trigger is no longer true, therefore the phantasm triggered-layer fails to resolve and does not generate any effects.
5.3.2c If the layer is a defense reaction card and it cannot become a defending card on the current chain link, the layer fails to resolve.
5.3.3 Static effects: First, static abilities of the layer become functional.[1.7.4]
5.3.4 Layer effects: Second, each of the resolution abilities of the layer generates its effects in the order specified (except go again).
5.3.4a If the parameters of any effect are undetermined, those parameters are determined before the effect is generated[1.8.6].
5.3.4b If an effect fails, any remaining effects continue to be generated[1.8.9].
5.3.4c If the layer no longer exists after the generation of an effect, the last known information of the layer is used to determine the remainder of the resolution abilities and the effects that are generated[1.2.3].
5.3.4d If the layer is melded[8.3.38] and it is its first time being resolved, only the right-side resolution abilities generate their effects, then resolution stops and the turn player gains priority; if it is the second time is being resolved, only the left-side resolution abilities generate their effects, then resolution continues.
5.3.5 Go again: Third, if the layer has go again, the controlling player gains 1 action point[8.3.5].
5.3.5a If the layer no longer exists, the last known information of the layer is used to determine whether the layer had go again[1.2.3].
5.3.6 Leave stack: Fourth, if a rule or effect would cause the layer to leave the stack, it does so.
5.3.6a A card-layer that becomes a permanent is moved to the arena.[8.2.4][8.2.13][8.2.5][8.2.9]
5.3.6b A card-layer with the type defense reaction becomes a defending card active chain link.[8.1.3]
5.3.7 Clear: Fifth and finally, if the layer is still on the stack, it is cleared[3.0.12], then the turn player gains priority.
5.4 Static Abilities
5.4.1 A static ability is an ability that generates effects without resolving a layer on the stack. Static abilities are written as statements.
5.4.2 Static abilities that are functional generate static continuous effects.[6.2.3]
5.4.3 A meta-static ability is a static ability that generates effects that apply to the rules outside of the game.
5.4.3a If a meta-static ability that modifies rules outside the game ceases to exist during a game, it does not affect the legality of the rules followed outside the game.
Example: Shiyana, Diamond Gemini has the text "You may have specialization cards of any hero in your deck." If the player controlling Shiyana has specialization cards in their card-pool, and Shiyana lost this meta static ability during a game, having specialization cards in the card-pool is still legal.
5.4.4 A play-static ability is a static ability that generates effects that apply to the playing of its source card.
5.4.4a An additional-cost ability is a play-static ability that adds one or more asset-costs and/or effect-costs to play the source card. Additional-cost abilities are typically written in the format "As an additional cost to play this [COST]," where COST is the additional cost to be paid. An additional-cost ability is optional if the COST of the ability uses the term "may" and must be declared when playing a card[5.1.3].
5.4.4b An alternative-cost ability is a play-static ability that replaces one or more asset-costs and/or effect-costs to play the source card. Alternative-cost abilities are typically written in the format "You may [COST] rather than pay this's [BASE]," where COST is the alternative cost to be paid instead of the cards BASE asset-costs and/or effect-costs. Alternative-cost abilities are optional and must be declared when playing a card[5.1.3]. An alternative cost has no effect on any additional costs that must be paid or modifications to the asset-cost.
5.4.4c If a play-static ability generates a triggered effect that references the playing of its source, the effect triggers immediately if the trigger condition is met. Triggered effects of play-static abilities are typically written in the format "[EFFECT]. When you do, [ABILITIES]," where the trigger condition is playing the card using the preceding effect of the play-static ability.[6.6]
Note: Cards printed before 2022 have also used the format "[COST]. If you do, [ABILITIES]," where ABILITIES generate one or more discrete effects.
Example: Rifted Torment has the text "You may play this from your banished zone. When you do, deal 1 arcane damage to target hero," which is a play-static ability that generates a triggered effect that is triggered when the Rift Bind is played from the banished zone this way.
5.4.4d If a play-static ability generates a conditional continuous effect that references the playing of its source, the effect is generated at the time the condition is met. Conditional continuous effects of play-static abilities are typically written in the format "[EFFECT]. If you do, [CONTINUOUSEFFECT]," where the replacement condition is playing the card using the proceeding effect of the play-static ability.
Example: Rift Bind has the text "You may play Rift Bind from your banished zone. If you do, it gains +X{p}, where X is the number of 'non-attack' action cards you have played this turn," which is a play-static ability that generates a conditional continuous effect when the Rift Bind is played from the banished zone.
5.4.5 A property-static ability is a static ability that defines the property, or value of a property, on an object that would normally be found elsewhere on that object.
Example: Mutated Mass has the text "Mutated Mass's {p} and {d} is equal to twice the number of cards in your pitch zone with different costs," which is a property-static ability that defines the power and defense of the card, otherwise printed on the card with (c).
5.4.5a Property-static abilities function anywhere in and outside the game.
5.4.6 A triggered-static ability is a static ability that generates a single triggered effect.[6.6]
5.4.6a If the source of a triggered-static ability ceases to exist from an event that would trigger its effect, and the ability was functional immediately before the event occurs, then the triggered effect is triggered.
Example: Merciful Retribution has the text "Whenever an aura or attack action card you control is destroyed, deal 1 arcane damage to target hero. [...]." If Merciful Retribution is in the arena under the control of a player and is destroyed, its triggered effect will trigger, because the destruction event of Merciful Retribution is also the condition of the effect.
5.4.7 A while-static ability is a static ability with a condition that makes it functional under specified circumstances. While-conditional abilities are written in the format "While [CONDITION], [ABILITY]" or "If [CONDITION], while [CONDITION], [ABILITY]," where the ABILITY is the static ability that is functional whenever the CONDITION is met.
Example: Yinti Yanti has the text "While Yinti Yanti is defending and you control an aura, it has +1{d}," which is a while-static ability that is functional when it is a non-permanent defending card because it has a while-condition that is met when the card is defending.
5.4.7a A while-static ability is functional when its while-condition is met and when its source is public, when its source is private if the while-condition explicitly specifies it, or when its source is private and the while-condition specifies it functions in that private zone. Otherwise, a while-static ability is not functional.
Example: Heave is a while-static ability that means "While this is in your hand, [...]," where the while condition specifies the source being in a zone that is private by default. This means that Heave is functional when its source is private in the player's hand.
Example: Blood Debt is a while-static ability that means "While this is in your banished zone, [...]," where the while-condition specifies the source being in a zone that is public by default. This means that Blood Debt is not functional when its source is private in the player's banished zone.
5.4.7b A hidden triggered ability is both a while-static ability and triggered-static ability, where the while-condition specifies that the source is private or in a private zone. If the triggered condition is met while the ability is functional and the source is private, the owner may decide to trigger the effect. If they do, the source of the ability becomes public and the triggered effect produces a triggered-layer to be added to the stack. The source remains public until the triggered-layer resolves or otherwise ceases to exist, and then it returns to being private.
Example: The Librarian has the text "While The Librarian is face down in arsenal, at the start of your turn, you may turn him face up," which is a hidden triggered ability that is functional when The Librarian is face down in arsenal and the start of turn event occurs. The player decides to trigger the effect, The Librarian becomes public, and when its triggered-layer resolves it is officially turned face up in the arsenal.
6 Effects
6.0 General
6.1 Discrete Effects
6.1.1 A discrete effect is an effect that changes the game state by producing an event[1.9]. Discrete effects have no duration, and after the completion of their event, they have no further influence to the game state.
6.1.2 Discrete effects are atomic. If two or more discrete effects would be generated, they are generated and produce their event one at a time.
Example: Sand Sketched Plan has the text "Search your deck for a card, put it into your hand, discard a random card, then shuffle your deck," which is a resolution ability that generates four atomic discrete effects: search ([8.5.19]), put ([8.5.15]), discard ([8.5.5]), and shuffle ([8.5.20]). Each effect is generated and produces an event before the next one in order is generated.
6.1.3 If a discrete effect is conditional[1.8.4], its condition is evaluated only once, at the time the effect would be generated. If the condition is met, the effect is generated - otherwise, it is not.
6.2 Continuous Effects
6.2.1 A continuous effect modifies the state and properties of objects, and/or the rules of the game. Continuous effects either have a lasting influence effect on the game state, and continue for their specified duration, or for as long as their source ability is functional.
6.2.2 A layer-continuous effect is a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a layer. Layer continuous effects typically have a specified duration.
6.2.2a A layer-continuous effect starts as soon it is generated and ends after a specified duration. A specified duration is fixed at the time the effect is generated and does not change once generated. If no duration is explicitly specified by the effect, then the layer-continuous effect ends when it is no longer applicable.
Example: Stasis Cell has the text "[...] activated abilities of target equipment can't be activated until the end of its controller's next turn." which is a layer-continuous effect that has a duration until the current controller's next turn. If the controller of the equipment changes, the duration of the effect does not change.
6.2.2b If a layer-continuous effect has variable values (such as X), the values of those variables are determined when the continuous effect is generated and do not change thereafter. If the effect is a continuous effect that applies to an object that does not yet exist, the variables are determined when the effect first applies to an object and do not change thereafter.
Example: Tear Limb from Limb has the text "[...] the next Brute attack action card you play this turn gains +X{p}, where X is its base {p}," which is a layer-continuous effect where X is determined at the time the effect first starts to apply to an object, not when it is first generated.
6.2.2c If a layer-continuous effect starts to apply to an object, it continues to apply to that object even if the properties of that object change.
Example: Primeval Bellow (red) has the text "Your next Brute attack this turn gains +5{p}." If the player plays and resolves Primeval Bellow, then Pack Hunt (a brute attack); even if the supertype brute of Pack Hunt is removed, the effect of Primeval Bellow will still apply to the Pack Hunt.
6.2.2d If a layer-continuous effect is conditional on being generated[1.8.4], its condition is evaluated only once, at the time the effect would be generated. If the condition is met, the effect is generated - otherwise, it is not. If the effect is conditional on being applied, the condition is still checked continuously[1.8.4c].
6.2.3 A static-continuous effect is a continuous effect generated by a static ability. Static-continuous effects never have a specified duration.
6.2.3a A static-continuous effect starts as soon as the static ability that generated it becomes functional and ends when the static ability becomes non-functional[1.7.4].
6.2.3b If a static-continuous effect has variable values (such as X), the value of those variables are determined based on the current game state and are updated if the game state changes.
6.2.3c A static-continuous effect only applies to an object while it has the properties described by the effect - if the properties of an object change, the static effect may no longer apply to that object.
6.2.3d If a static-continuous effect is conditional on being generated[1.8.4], its condition is evaluated at all times. The effect is generated when the condition is met and ceases to exist when the condition is not met.
Example: Luminaris has the text "If there is a yellow card in your pitch zone, Illusionist attacks you control have go again," which is a conditional static-continuous effect that only exists when there is a card with a yellow color strip in the controlling player's pitch zone and does not exist otherwise.
6.2.4 If a continuous effect would only apply to a future object that is yet to exist, it starts to apply to the next object that meets the specification of the effect.
Example: Come to Fight has the text "The next attack action card you play this turn gains +3{p}," which is a layer-continuous effect that applies to the next attack action card the player plays after the generation of the effect.
6.2.5 The first time a continuous effect applies to an object, or when a continuous effect changes how it modifies an object, it applies as an event which can be modified by replacement effects and trigger triggered effects. Each application of a continuous effect is considered a separate event.
Example: Talisman of Featherfoot has the text "When an attack you control gains exactly +1{p} from an effect during the reaction step, [...]." If an attack has 0 base power and is affected by a -1{p} continuous effect, then it is affected by a new +2{p} effect during the reaction step, Talisman of Featherfoot would not trigger because an effect of exactly +1{p} has not been applied during the reaction step.
6.2.5a If two or more effects would apply to an object at the same time, they are applied in the order determined staging.[6.3.1].
Example: Flourish (yellow) has the text "The next time an attack would gain {p} this turn, instead it gains that much plus 3." If there are two static continuous effects that increase {p} and would apply to an object at the same time, the player chooses the order of those effects and thus which one is modified by Flourish's replacement effect.
6.3 Continuous Effect Interactions
6.3.1 Continuous effects that modify the rules of the game are applied simultaneously before continuous effects that modify objects. If there are two or more continuous effects that modify the state and/or properties of objects in the game, the effects are applied using the staging system. These effects are grouped into stages and are applied in ascending stage order, then if there are two or more effects in the same stage, the effects are applied using substage order, then timestamp order.
Example: Hypothermia has the text "Attacks you control can't gain go again," which is a continuous effect that modifies the rules of the game and is applied before any effects would add the go again ability to an attack you control.
6.3.2 Stage order is defined by how an effect applies to the object. Effects are grouped into stages and are applied in ascending stage order. If there are two or more effects in the same stage, the effects are applied using substage order[6.3.3].
Stage 1: Effects that modify copyable properties are applied.[8.5.25]
Stage 2: Effects that modify or are dependent on the controller are applied.
Stage 3: Effects that modify or are dependent on name, color strip, or text box are applied.
Stage 4: Effects that modify or are dependent on types or subtypes are applied.
Stage 5: Effects that modify or are dependent on supertypes are applied.
Stage 6: Effects that modify or are dependent on abilities are applied.
Stage 7: Effects that modify or are dependent on the base values of numeric properties are applied.
Stage 8: Effects and counters that modify or are dependent on the values of numeric properties are applied.
6.3.2a An effect is dependent on a stage if the application of another effect in that stage would have changed the first application of this effect, and that stage is higher than the stage for this effect. An effect is independent if it is not dependent on any stages. Dependent effects are applied in the stage on which they are dependent.
Example: Thump has the text "While Thump's {p} is greater than its base {p}, it has dominate and 'When this hits a hero, they discard a card.' " which is an effect that is dependent on the value of the power {p} numerical property (stage 8) and affects the object's abilities (stage 6). Because effects in stage 8 can change the application of Thump's effect, and stage 8 is higher than stage 6, Thump's effect is considered dependent and is applied in stage 8 (substage 7).
6.3.2b If an effect is dependent on two or more stages, it is applied at the highest of all those stages.
6.3.2c If separate parts of an effect are applied in different stages, the separate parts of the effect each apply in their respective stages.
6.3.3 Substage order is used if there are two or more effects in the same stage and is defined by the dependence and type of modification within each stage. For stages 1--6, substage order is used to apply independent effects before dependent effects. For stages 7--8, effects are grouped into the following substages and are applied in ascending substage order. Substage 1:* All effects that add/remove a numerical property to/from the object are applied.
Substage 2: Independent effects that set the value of a numerical property are applied.
Substage 3: Independent effects that multiply the value of a numerical property are applied.
Substage 4: Independent effects that divide the value of a numerical property are applied.
Substage 5: Independent effects that add to the value of a numerical property are applied.
Substage 6: Independent effects that subtract from the value of a numerical property are applied.
Substage 7: Dependent effects are applied.
6.3.3a If there are two or more effects in the same substage, the effects are applied using timestamp order[6.3.4].
6.3.4 Timestamp order is used when there are two or more effects in the same substage and is defined by the timestamp of when an effect was first generated. Effects are applied in chronological timestamp order. If there are two or more effects with the same timestamp, the order is determined by the turn player.
6.3.4a The timestamp of an effect is the moment it was generated by an ability. Layer-continuous effects are generated when their source resolves as a layer on the stack[6.2.2] and static-continuous effects are generated when the static ability becomes functional[6.2.3].
6.3.4b If two or more effects start to apply to an object at the same time the turn player decides the order that effects apply. This decided order is only used to determine the order of effects with the same timestamps. Once a player has decided the order of effects, the order cannot be changed.
6.3.4c When a new effect is applied to an object in a given substage of ordered effects, that effect is ordered after the existing effects in that substage.
6.3.5 Continuous effects are applied dynamically. If a new effect would apply, an effect no longer applies, or an effect that is already applied is modified, all of the effects are recalculated automatically in stage order.
6.3.5a If an object is modified by an effect that would make it eligible/ineligible for another effect in the current or future stage/substage, that effect is added/removed to the set of effects to be applied in that stage/substage.
Example: Minnowism (red) has the text "The next attack action card with 3 or less base {p} you play this turn gains +3{p}," which is a layer-continuous effect applied in stage 8. If an attack action card with 6 base power is played, and its base power is reduced to 3 in stage 7, it becomes eligible for the application of Minnowism's effect, which will be added and applied later in stage 8.
6.3.5b If an object is modified by an effect that would make it applicable to another effect in a previous stage/substages, that other effect is not retroactively applied.
6.3.6 Continuous effects that remove a property, or part of a property, from an object do not remove properties, or parts of properties, that were added by another effect.
Example: Erase Face has the text "When Erase Face hits a hero, cards and tokens they own lose all class and talent types until the end of their next turn," which removes any existing class and talent supertypes of the object, but does not remove or prevent the addition of class and talent supertypes gained from other effects, such as Brand with Cinderclaw.
6.3.7 Continuous effects only prevent properties, or parts of properties, from being added, removed, or otherwise modified if they explicitly specify.
Example: Hypothermia has the text "Attacks you control can't gain go again," which prevents effects from adding the go again ability to the object, but does not remove the go again ability if it is a base ability of the object.
6.4 Replacement Effects
6.4.1 A replacement effect is a type of effect that replaces an event with a modified event. A replacement effect typically specifies the conditions for the event to be replaced and the partial or full replacement.
6.4.1a A sub-event is an event that may occur when a replacement effect replaces an event. Sub-events occur when the event is replaced, before the original event, and may also be replaced by replacement effects.
Example: Ward 1 is a replacement effect that destroys its source and prevents 1 damage. The destruction of its source is a sub-event that occurs before the event of damage is dealt.
6.4.2 A replacement effect is considered active if an event is about to occur that can be replaced by the effect.
6.4.2a The condition of replacement and any variable values are determined each time a replacement effect could be applied to an event.
Example: Arcanite Fortress has the text "Spellvoid X, where X is the number of equipment you control with Arcanite in their name." The value of X for Spellvoid is determined each time the replacement effect of Spellvoid could be applied. If another replacement effect is applied first, the value of X is recalculated before Spellvoid can be applied.
6.4.3 A replacement effect must exist before an event occurs to replace it. If a replacement effect is generated after an event occurs, it does not retroactively replace that event.
6.4.4 A replacement effect can replace an event that has been modified by another replacement effect, as long as the effect is active for that modified event.
6.4.5 A replacement effect can only replace an event once per original event. It cannot replace its own modified event, or any further modified events produced by other replacement effects if it has already replaced the event.
6.4.6 If an event is replaced with a modified event, the event does not occur and the modified event occurs instead. The modified event may cause other replacement effects to be active that would not have been active for the replaced event. If the modified event occurs, it may trigger effects that the replaced event would not have triggered.
6.4.7 A self-replacement effect is a replacement effect that applies to a preceding effect generated by either the same ability or a leading connected ability[1.7.6]. A self-replacement effect is typically written in the format "[EFFECT]. [CONDITION], instead [MODIFICATION]," where EFFECT (if any) is the preceding effect the replacement applies to, CONDITION specifies the replacement condition, and MODIFICATION specifies the partial or full replacement of the event created by the preceding effect.
Example: Tome of Divinity has the text "Draw 2 cards. If a card has been put into your soul this turn, instead draw 3 cards." This is a discrete effect and self-replacement effect. When the card resolves on the stack, if the player has put a card into their hero's soul this turn, the self-replacement effect replaces the event of drawing 2 cards with drawing 3 cards.
6.4.7a A self-replacement effect does not modify any event other than the event created by the proceeding effect on its source, or the effect of the leading connected ability.
6.4.7b The condition of a self-replacement effect is evaluated at the time the preceding effect is generated. If the condition is dependent on any undetermined parameters of the preceding effect, it is evaluated at the time those parameters are determined.
Example: Weave Earth (red) has the text "The next Earth or Elemental attack action card you play this turn gains +3 {p}. If it's fused, instead it gains +4{p}." the latter of which is a self-replacement effect with a condition that is dependent on the parameters of a future card. When an Earth or Elemental attack action card is played later that turn, the parameter of whether it is fused is determined, the condition of the self-replacement effect is evaluated, and the self-replacement effect may be applied.
6.4.8 An identity-replacement effect is a replacement effect. Identity-replacement effects are typically written in the format "As [CONDITION] [MODIFICATION]," or "[CONDITION] (as/with) [MODIFICATION]," where CONDITION describes an event, typically an object entering the arena, and MODIFICATION describes the modifications to the event.
Example: Hyper Driver (red) has the text "This enters the arena with 3 steam counters." This is an identity-replacement effect where the condition is the Hyper Driver entering the arena and the modification is that it enters the arena with 3 steam counters on it.
6.4.8a An identity-replacement effect that modifies the properties of the specified object defines its copyable properties.
6.4.9 A standard-replacement effect is a continuous replacement effect. A standard-replacement effect is typically written in the format "(If / The next) [CONDITION], instead [MODIFICATION]," where CONDITION specifies the condition for the replacement effect to be active, and MODIFICATION describes the modifications to the effect before it occurs.
Note: Cards printed before 2022 have also used the format "(When / Whenever) [CONDITION] instead [EFFECT]."
6.4.10 A prevention effect is a replacement effect that replaces a damage event with a modified event. Prevention effects are typically written in a format "[CONDITION?] prevent [PREVENTION]," where the CONDITION (if any) specifies the replacement condition, and PREVENTION is the modification which specifies the total amount of damage the effect can prevent, damage type(s) (if any), the shielded object(s) and/or source(s) of the damage event, and additional modifications to the event (if any).
6.4.10a If a prevention effect is applied to a damage event, for every 1 damage of the given type that would be dealt to the shielded object from the damage source, the 1 damage is prevented and the remaining prevention amount of the effect is reduced by 1. If the prevention amount has been reduced to 0, any remaining damage is dealt as normal.
6.4.10b If the prevention amount is not explicitly specified, the prevention amount is defined as the amount of damage in the damage event.
Example: Feign Death has the text "The next time you would be dealt damage this turn, prevent it," which does not explicitly specify the prevention amount. If the damage event that Feign Death will apply to is 3 damage, then the prevention amount of this effect is considered to be 3.
6.4.10c If the prevention damage type is not specified, the prevention applies to any and all damage types. If the prevention damage type is specified, the prevention only applies to that type of damage.
6.4.10d If the source of the damage event is not specified, the prevention applies to all damage that applies to the specified shielded object(s).
6.4.10e If the shielded object is not specified, the prevent applies to all damage dealt by the specified source(s) of the damage event.
6.4.10f If there are two or more types of damage in the event that the prevention can apply to, and/or two or more shielded objects the damage event will deal damage to, the controller of the prevention effect declares each point of damage the effect will prevent.
6.4.10g If an effect decreases the amount a prevention effect would prevent, the total prevention is determined, the prevention effect's prevention amount is reduced, and then the prevention effect is applied to the event with the decrease.
Example: Vambrace of Determination has the text "The next prevention effect that prevents {p} damage this turn, prevents 1 less of that damage." If Feign Death's effect would be applied to an event of 3{p} damage, first the total prevention is established as 3, then it is reduced by Vambrace of Determination's effect, preventing only 2 damage.
Example: Vambrace of Determination has the text "The next prevention effect that prevents {p} damage this turn, prevents 1 less of that damage." If Bone Head Barrier's effect has a prevention amount of 3 and would be applied to an event of 3{p} damage, first the total prevention is established as 3, the Bone Head Barrier's prevention amount is subtracted, then the total prevention is reduced by Vambrace of Determination's effect. Bone Head Barrier can't prevent any more damage as its prevention amount is 0, but it only prevents 2 damage.
6.4.10h If an effect states that a prevention effect cannot prevent the damage of an event, the prevention effect still applies to the event but its prevention amount is not reduced. Any additional modifications to the event by the prevention effect still occur.
Example: Spectral Shield has the text "If your hero would be dealt damage, instead destroy Spectral Shield and prevent 1 damage that source would deal," which is a fixed-prevention effect with an additional modification that destroys the source. If a damage event occurs that cannot be prevented, Spectral Shield's prevention effect applies once to the event but does not reduce the damage dealt and Spectral Shield is still destroyed.
Example: Steadfast has the text "Prevent the next 6 damage that would be dealt to your hero this turn by a source of your choice," which is a shielding-prevention effect. If a damage event occurs that cannot be prevented, Steadfast's prevention effect applies once to the event but does not reduce the damage dealt and does not have its prevention amount reduced. As such will still be able to prevent a total of 6 damage from the source after the event.
6.4.10i A fixed-prevention effect is a prevention effect that acts as a one-off effect. It prevents a specific amount of damage from an event that activates it. Fixed-prevention effects are typically written in the format "[CONDITION], prevent [PREVENTION]." After a fixed-prevention effect prevents damage, any remaining prevention amount is not used to prevent a subsequent damage event.
Example: Dissipation Shield has the text "Instant - Destroy Dissipation Shield: The next time your hero would be dealt damage this turn, prevent X damage, where X is the number of steam counters on Dissipation Shield," which is a fixed-prevention effect that modifies to the next event that would deal damage to your hero this turn but does modify any additional damage events that turn.
6.4.10j A shielding-prevention effect is a prevention effect that acts as a shield. It prevents a specific amount of damage from any number of events that activate it. Shielding-prevention effects are typically written in the format "[CONDITION?] prevent the next [PREVENTION]." After a shielding-prevention effect prevents damage, any remaining prevention amount is used to prevent a future damage event. If the prevention amount of a shielding-prevention effect is reduced to zero, the effect ceases to exist.
Example: Bone Head Barrier has the text "Roll a 6 sided die. Prevent the next X damage that would be dealt to your hero this turn, where X is the number rolled," which is a shielding-prevention effect that applies to every event that would deal damage to your hero this turn until X damage has been prevented in total.
6.4.11 An outcome-replacement effect is a replacement effect that replaces the outcome of an event with another event. A outcome-replacement effect is typically written in the format "(If / The next) [CONDITION], instead [MODIFICATION]," where CONDITION specifies the condition for the replacement effect to be active, and MODIFICATION describes the modifications to the effect before it occurs.
Example: Victor has the text "The first time each turn you would fail to win a clash, instead you may destroy a Gold you control. If you do, put 1 of the revealed cards on the bottom of its owner's deck, then clash again." This is an outcome-replacement effect where the condition is failing to win a clash and the modification is choosing to destroy a gold, modifying the top of a deck, and clashing again.
6.5 Replacement Effect Interactions
6.5.1 If there are two or more replacement effects that could replace an event with a modified event, then effects are applied based on an order determined by the turn player and then an order determined by each controlling player.
6.5.2 Select Player: First, the turn player selects a player. When a type of replacement effect is applied, each player in clockwise order applies their active replacement effects of that type one-by-one until they do not control any more active replacement effects of that type; starting with the selected player and ending when there are no more active replacement effects of that type to apply.
6.5.2a The turn player does not determine the order of effects they do not control, only the first player to apply replacement effects.
6.5.2b The selected player is determined once per event and does not change.
6.5.3 Self-replacement and Identity-replacement: Second, each player applies any self- or identity- replacement effects they control.
6.5.4 Standard-replacement: Third, each player applies any active standard-replacement effects they control.
6.5.5 Prevention: Fourth, each player applies any active prevention effects they control.
6.5.6 Event: Fifth, the event occurs.
6.5.7 Outcome-replacement: Sixth, each player applies any active outcome-replacement effects they control.
6.5.8 Event: Seventh, and finally, the event is complete.
6.6 Triggered Effects
6.6.1 A triggered effect is an effect that can be triggered to put a triggered-layer on the stack. Triggered effects are typically written in the format "[LIMIT?] (When / Whenever / At / The [ORDINAL] time / The next time) [EVENT and/or STATE] [ABILITIES]." Triggered effects never use the term "instead"[6.4].
Note: Cards printed before 2022 have also used the format "If  [EVENT and/or STATE] [ABILITIES]" and "[LIMIT?] effect - (When / Whenever) [EVENT and/or STATE] [ABILITIES]."
6.6.1a The LIMIT (if any) specifies the trigger limit, which is the maximum number of times the effect can be triggered. If there is no limit, the effect can be triggered any number of times.
6.6.1b The ORDINAL (if any) is one or more ordinal numbers that specify which event(s) within the given duration will match the trigger condition.
6.6.1c The EVENT and/or STATE specifies the event- and/or state-trigger condition that triggers the effect and creates a triggered-layer. If the triggered condition describes an event (or an event and state), the effect is an event-based triggered effect; if the trigger condition describes a game state, the effect is a state-based triggered effect. The trigger condition is not inclusive of the conditions of any effects the triggered-layer would generate[1.8.4].
6.6.1d The ABILITIES specifies the resolution abilities of the triggered-layer created by the effect. When the triggered-layer resolves, the resolution abilities of the layer generate effects.
6.6.2 An inline-triggered effect is a discrete triggered effect that can only trigger when it is generated. Inline-triggered effects are typically written in the format "When [CONDITION] [EFFECT]."
Example: Belittle has the text "As an additional cost to play Belittle, you may reveal an attack action card with 3 or less base {p} from your hand. When you do, search your deck for a card named Minnowism, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your deck," where the latter effect is an inline-triggered effect that is conditional on the payment of the preceding effect-cost.
6.6.2a An inline-triggered effect does not trigger retroactively if the condition is met after the effect is generated.
6.6.3 A delayed-triggered effect is a layer-continuous triggered effect. Delayed triggered effects typically contain, but do not start with the phrase "(when / whenever / at / the [ORDINAL] time / the next time)," or they start with the phrase "The next time."
Example: Lead the Charge (blue) has the text "The next time you play an action card with cost {r}{r} or greater this turn, gain 1 action point," which is a delayed-triggered effect that triggers and creates a triggered-layer when the player plays a card with that cost. When the triggered-layer resolves the player gains 1 action point.
6.6.3a A delayed triggered effect always specifies its duration, unless it is conditional on a change in phase (end of turn) or step (combat chain closes), in which case the effect lasts until it is triggered.
6.6.4 A static-triggered effect is a static-continuous triggered effect. Static triggered effects typically start with the phrase "[LIMIT?] (When / Whenever)" or  "At / The [ORDINAL] time)."
Note: Cards printed before 2022 have also used the format "[LIMIT] Effect -- [EFFECT]," where LIMIT (if any) specifies the maximum number of times the triggered effect can be triggered, and EFFECT specifies the triggered effect of the ability.
Example: Rhinar has the text "When you discard a card with 6 or more {p} during your action phase, intimidate," which is a static-triggered effect that triggers and creates a triggered-layer when you discard a card with 6 or more {p}, and when that triggered-layer resolves, the intimidate effect is generated.
6.6.5 If a game event or game state meets a triggered effect's trigger condition, the effect is considered triggered. When an effect is triggered, it creates a triggered-layer.
6.6.5a A triggered effect must exist before an event or change in state occurs that satisfies its trigger condition, for it to be triggered. If a triggered effect is generated after an event or change in state occurs that satisfies its trigger condition, it does not retroactively trigger. The exception is inline-triggered effects, which triggers as it is generated if its trigger condition is met.
6.6.5b An event-based triggered effect only triggers if an event that meets the triggered condition occurs. If the event is modified before it occurs and no longer meets the triggered condition, the effect does not trigger[6.4]. If the trigger condition also includes a state-trigger condition, that condition must also be met by the game state at the time the event occurs for the effect to trigger.
6.6.5c A state-based triggered effect triggers if the game state did not initially meet the trigger condition, then changes and meets the trigger condition. If a state-based triggered effect is generated while the game state meets the trigger condition, the effect will trigger.
Example: Hyper Driver (blue) has the text "This enters the arena with a steam counter. When it has none, destroy it." the latter of which is a state-based triggered effect. If a Hyper Driver enters the arena with no steam counters, the triggered effect is generated, the state-based condition is met, and the effect is triggered, destroying the Hyper Driver on resolution.
6.6.5d If the trigger condition is proceeded by an ordinal as part of the condition, the effect will only trigger on the specified ordinal time(s) the condition is met, relative to the specified duration. If the effect becomes functional after the specified ordinal time(s) the condition would be met, the effect will not trigger for the rest of the specified duration.
Example: If a card has the text "The first time you boost each turn, gain an action point," and it is put into the arena as a permanent after you've boosted that turn, it will not trigger the next time you boost that turn because the ordinal time "first" is relative to the turn and has already happened.
6.6.5e If the triggered effect is triggered, but it would exceed the maximum number of times specified by the trigger limit (if any), the triggered-layer is not created and will not be added to the stack.
6.6.5f If the triggered effect is triggered, but there is an effect that prevents it from triggering, the triggered-layer is not created and will not be added to the stack. However, the triggering still counts towards the limit of the effect (if any).
Example: Katsu has the text "The first time an attack action card you control hits each turn, [...]" and Tripwire Trap has the text "Hit effects don't trigger this chain link [...]."  If the Tripwire Trap continuous effect is active and the player that controls Katsu hits with an attack action card, the Katsu triggered effect will not produce a triggered-layer on the stack because Tripwire Trap continuous effect prevents it. The next time this turn the player that controls Katsu hits with an attack action card, the Katsu triggered effect will not produce a triggered-layer on the stack because the once-per-turn limit has already been reached.
6.6.6 When a triggered-layer is created, it is added to the stack before the next player receives priority as a game state process.[1.10.2]
6.6.6a When a triggered-layer is added to the stack, the player that controls the effect must declare the parameters of all abilities of that layer. If the card has any modal resolution abilities, the player must declare the modes for those abilities[1.7.5]. Then, if any resolution abilities generate effects that require a target, the player must declare all legal targets for those effects [1.8.5]. If no legal targets can be declared, the triggered-layer ceases to exist and is not added to the stack.
Example: Thaw has the text "While Thaw is in your graveyard, at the start of your turn, you may banish it and choose 1: Destroy target Frostbite. Destroy target Ice affliction. Unfreeze target frozen card." To add Thaw's triggered-layer to the stack, the controlling player must first select the mode and choose a legal target for that mode, otherwise the triggered-layer ceases to exist and will not be added to the stack.
6.6.6b If two or more triggered-layers would have been created, the turn player selects a player, then each player in clockwise order adds all pending triggered-layers they control onto the stack in an order they choose, starting with the selected player.
Example: Celestial Kimono has the text "[...] when or a non-token permanent you control with ward is destroyed, gain {r}." and Diadem of Dreamstate has the text "[...] when this [...] is destroyed, you may pay {r}. If you do, create a Ponder token. Ward 1." If Diadem of Dreamstate is destroyed, the controlling player may choose to order their trigger-layers so they gain {r} from Celestial Kimono before paying {r} for Diadem of Dreamstate, even if they are not the turn player.
7 Combat
7.0 General
7.0.1 Combat is a game state where the combat chain is open and attacks undergo resolution in steps on the stack and combat chain. The resolution of a chain link consists of seven steps in order: Layer, Attack, Defend, Reaction, Damage, and Resolution.
7.0.1a During combat, while the combat chain is open, a player cannot play cards or activate activated abilities with the type action, except for attacks during the Resolution Step of combat[7.6]. An action card/ability can still be played/activated as an instant during any step of combat when a player has priority.
7.0.2 The combat chain is a zone[3.6] that is open during combat and closed otherwise. It comprises chain links when it is open, and is empty when it is closed.
7.0.2a The combat chain starts the game closed. If the combat chain is closed and an attack is added to the stack, the combat chain opens and the Layer Step begins immediately. The combat chain remains open until it is closed again[7.7.2].
7.0.2b When referring to combat chain as a time, the combat chain starts when it opens and ends when closes. If an effect states "this combat chain" it refers to the current combat chain if it is open - if the combat chain is closed the effect fails to be generated.
7.0.3 A chain link is an element of the combat chain and represents the resolution of an attack. A chain link is neither an object nor a zone. A chain link comprises an active-attack, an attack-source (if any), and any number of defending cards.
7.0.3a A chain link is created when an attack is added to the combat chain as a chain link[7.2.3]. The attack becomes the active-attack of chain link N+1, where N is the number of existing chain links on the combat chain.
7.0.3b The active chain link is the most recent chain link of the combat chain. When chain link N+1 is created, chain link N (if any) becomes the previous chain link and chain link N+1 becomes the active chain link, until the combat chain closes.
7.0.3c When referring to a chain link as a collection, the properties, control, and ownership of a chain link are considered to be the same as the active-attack of that chain link. If the active-attack of a chain link ceases to exist, last known information about the active-attack is used to determine the properties, control, and ownership.[1.2.3]
Example: Double Strike has the text "When this chain link resolves, banish this." Even if the Double Strike ceases to exist, the chain link remains, and is considered a Ninja chain link controlled by the attacking hero.
7.0.3d When referring to a chain link as a time, a chain link starts when it becomes the active chain link and ends when it is no longer the active chain link or the combat chain closes. If an effect states "this chain link" it refers to the active chain link - if there is no active chain link (the combat chain is closed) the effect fails to be generated.
7.0.3e When a layer is added to the stack while the combat chain is open, it is considered to be played/activated/triggered on the active chain link (if any), for rules and effects[7.0.3b]. If there is no active chain link on the combat chain, it is not considered to be played/activated/triggered on any chain link.
7.0.3f To put a card on a chain link, that card moves to the combat chain and is associated with that chain link until it leaves the combat chain. Cards on a chain link are considered to be on the combat chain and in the arena.
7.0.4 An active-attack, is an attack that has been put onto the combat chain as a chain link[1.4][7.0.3a].
7.0.4a If a card is put onto a chain link as an attacking card, the existing active-attack (if any) is cleared, and the new card becomes the active-attack for that chain link. It is considered a new attack, but the attack target(s) remain the same.
Example: Uzuri has the text "[...] put target attacking card with stealth from the active chain link on the bottom of its owner's deck, then put the banished card onto the active chain link as the attacking card." The card with stealth is essentially replaced by the banished card as the attack on the chain link. The banished card is considered a new attack for rules and effects, except that the target of the attack stays the same.
7.0.5 A defending card is a card that is designated as defending on a chain link for an attack-target by a rule or effect[7.3.2][7.4.2d][8.5.32].
7.0.5a To be added as a defending card, the card is put on the respective chain link. The card is considered to be defending until it leaves the combat chain. Then the "defend" event occurs and effects that trigger from defending are triggered. The controller of the card at the time it defends is considered to have defended with that card.
Example: Surging Militia has the text "This gets +1{p} for each non-equipment card defending it." and Inertia Trap has the text "When this defends an attack with {p} greater than its base, [...]" When Inertia Trap becomes a defending card against Surging Militia, the Surging Militia will gain +1{p} before the defend event occurs, and thus Inertia Trap will trigger.
7.0.5b If an effect would add a card on a chain link as a defending card, but the card is already defending on that chain link or the card cannot become a defending card due to another effect, the effect fails, no defend event occurs, and the card does not move zones.
Example: Amulet of Havencall has the text "Defense Reaction -- Destroy this: Search your deck for a Rally the Rearguard, add it to this chain link as a defending card, then shuffle." If Rally the Rearguard cannot be added as a defending card, it remains in the deck and the deck is shuffled.
Example: Quickdodge Flexors has the text "Defense Reaction -- {r}: Add this to the active chain link as a defending card. It has 2 base {d} this chain link." If Quickdodge Flexors is already defending card on the active chain link, then its ability is activated, it will remain a defending card on that chain link, no defend event will occur, but its base {d} will still be set to 2.
7.0.5c A defending card is considered to be defending against the active-attack on the chain link. If the active-attack ceases to exist, last known information about the active-attack is used to determine the properties, control, and ownership of the attack.[1.2.3]
7.0.5d A card can only defend on one chain link for one attack-target at a time. If there are multiple attack-targets and an effect adds a defending card to a chain link but does not specify which attack-target it defends for, the controller of the effect determines which attack-target it will defend for.
7.0.5e If exactly one card is put onto a chain link as a defending card it is considered to defend alone. If two or more cards are put onto a chain link as defending cards in the same event, they are considered to defend together.
Example: If a player declares two cards during the defend step of combat, those cards are considered to defend together. Then, if the player plays and resolves a defense reaction, that card is considered to defend alone because it is just one card being added as a defending card - despite there already being defending cards on the chain link.
7.1 Layer Step
7.1.1 The Layer Step is a game state where an attack is unresolved on the stack.
7.1.2 First, the turn player gains priority.
7.1.3 Second and finally, when the top layer of the stack is the attack and all players pass in succession, the Layer Step ends and the Attack Step begins.
7.2 Attack Step
7.2.1 The Attack Step is a game state where an attack resolves and becomes attacking before any defending cards are declared.
7.2.2 First, at least one of the attack's attack-targets[1.4.5] must still be a legal target. Otherwise, the Attack Step ends and the Close Step begins[7.7].
7.2.2a Only one target needs to be legal at this point of combat. If all attack-targets cease to be legal after this point, combat will continue.
7.2.3 Second, each of the resolution abilities of the attack generates its effects in the order specified (except go again), and then the attack moves onto the combat chain as a chain link[7.0.3].
Note: Attacks with resolution abilities that generate discrete effects printed before 2021 have received an errata that corrects them to be triggered effects that trigger when the attack becomes attacking.
7.2.3a If the attack is an attack-card, it moves onto the combat chain as a chain link. The attack-card is the active-attack.
Example: Head Jab is an attack action card. After the Head Jab resolves, it moves as an attack-card onto the combat chain as a chain link, and it is considered the active-attack.
7.2.3b If the attack is an attack-proxy, the attack and its attack-source move onto the combat chain as the chain link. The attack-proxy is the active-attack. If the attack-source was on a previous chain link, the attack-proxy on that chain link ceases to exist[1.4.3c].
Example: Bone Basher is a one-handed weapon with an attack activated ability. After an attack-proxy of Bone Basher resolves, the attack-proxy and Bone Basher move onto the combat chain as a chain link, and the attack-proxy is considered the active-attack.
7.2.3c If the attack is an attack-layer, the card specified by the attack-layer's effect moves onto the combat chain as a chain link. This card is the active-attack. All of the parameters and applied effects of the attack-layer transfer to the active-attack, and then the attack-layer ceases to exist.
Example: Emperor, Dracai of Aesir has the text "Search your deck for Command and Conquer, attack with it, then shuffle." After the ability resolves and Command and Conquer is found in the deck, the Command and Conquer moves to the combat chain as a chain link, and it is considered the active-attack.
7.2.3d If the active-attack does not exist, or cannot move to the combat chain as a chain link, the Attack Step ends and the Close Step begins[7.7].
Example: Emperor, Dracai of Aesir has the text "Search your deck for Command and Conquer, attack with it, then shuffle," where the active-attack is specified as the Command and Conquer. If the search fails to produce a Command and Conquer, the active-attack of the attack does not exist, so the combat chain closes.
7.2.4 Third, the active-attack is considered to be attacking until it leaves the combat chain. The "attack" event occurs and effects that trigger from attacking are triggered.
Example: The attack is Dread Triptych. The abilities "When this attacks, if you've played a non-attack action card this turn, create a Runechant token." and "When this attacks, if you've dealt arcane damage this turn, create a Runechant token." trigger and are added as separate triggered-layers on the stack.
7.2.4a If there is an attack-source, and it is a living object [2.5.1]), it becomes attacking. Otherwise, the controller of the attack and their hero card become the "attacking hero" until the active chain link resolves or the combat chain closes. If an effect of a source on the chain link refers to the attacking hero, it refers to that hero until the combat chain closes.
7.2.4b If the attack-target is a hero, that hero and their controller become the "defending hero" until the active chain link resolves or the combat chain closes. If an effect of a source on the chain link refers to the defending hero, it refers to that hero until the combat chain closes.
Example: Exude Confidence has the text "If this isn't defended by a card with greater or equal {p}, the defending hero can't play or activate instants and defense reactions," which is an effect that refers to the defending hero of the chain link where Exude Confidence the active-attack. If the next attack has a different attack-target, Exude Confidence's effect will still refer to that hero.
7.2.5 Fourth, the turn player gains priority.
7.2.6 Fifth and finally, when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, the Attack Step ends and the Defend Step begins.
7.3 Defend Step
7.3.1 The Defend Step is a game state where defending cards may be declared by a defending hero.
7.3.2 First, defending cards are declared for the attack-target(s). Cards declared this way become defending cards for the attack-target(s) on the active chain link[7.0.5]. Declaring a card this way is not considered playing that card - it does not incur the cost of playing that card, it does not add it as a layer on the stack, and it does not resolve any resolution abilities on that card.
7.3.2a If the attack-target is a hero (defending hero), their controller may declare any number of non-defense-reaction cards from their hand and/or public equipment permanents they control. Otherwise, a player may only declare cards for an attack-target if a rule or effect specifies it.
7.3.2b A card cannot be declared if (A) it does not have the defense property (0 is a value), (B) it is already a defending card on a chain link, or (C) it would make the current set of declared cards illegal to become defending.
Example: If an attack has overpower (can't be defended by more than one action card) and is already defended by an action card, an action card cannot be declared because it cannot become a defending card.
7.3.2c If a player declares two or more defending cards for an attack-target, they decide the order those cards are declared and become defending.
Example: Flic Flak has the text "If the next card you defend with this turn is a card with combo, it gains +2{d}." If a player declares two or more cards, they choose the order they become defending, and thus which of those cards Flic Flak's ability will apply to.
7.3.2d All declared cards for an attack-target are put onto the active chain link as a single compound event as defending cards for that attack-target. The order in which the declared cards become defending within the compound event is determined by the order in which were declared.[1.9.2]
Example: Bastion of Unity has the text "Unity - When this defends together with a card from hand, this gets +1{d} until end of turn." If one player declares Bastion of Unity and another player declares a card from hand, Bastion of Unity's effect will trigger because both cards defend together as part of the same compound event.
7.3.2e If two or more players may declare defending cards for an attack-target, they do so in clockwise order starting with the player that controls the attack-target[1.1.6].
Example: If a player's hero is attacked, that player declares any defending cards first, then in clockwise order, players may declare additional defending cards, such as cards with Protect.
7.3.2f If there are two or more attack-targets, defending cards are declared for each attack-target in clockwise order of their controller, starting from player that controls the attack[1.1.6]. Then, if two or more attack-targets are controlled by the same player, defending cards are declared for each attack-target in an order determined by that controlling player. Cards only defend the attack-target they are declared for. All declared cards for each attack target are put onto the active chain link in separate events as defending cards.
Example: Apocalypse Automaton has the text "This attacks up to X target opposing heroes, [...]." If two players' heroes are attacked by an Apocalypse Automaton, the defending cards for each hero are declared in clockwise order from the controller of the attack. The first hero's player declares defending cards, then any player may declare additional defending cards (such as cards with Protect), and finally, those declared cards become defending cards for that hero. This process then repeats for the second hero.
7.3.3 Second, the turn player gains priority.
7.3.4 Third and finally, when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, the Defend Step ends and the Reaction Step begins.
7.4 Reaction Step
7.4.1 The Reaction Step is a game state where players may use reactions related to combat.
7.4.2 First, the turn player gains priority.
7.4.2a The attacking hero (if any) may play/activate attack reaction cards/abilities when they have priority during the Reaction Step.
7.4.2b The defending hero(es) (if any) may play/activate defense reaction cards/abilities when they have priority during the Reaction Step.
7.4.2c A defense reaction card cannot be played if a rule or effect would prevent the player from defending with that card.
Example: If an attack has dominate (can't be defended by more than 1 card from hand) and is already defended by a card from hand, defence reaction cards cannot be played from hand because dominate prevents it from becoming a defending card.
7.4.2d When a defense reaction card resolves it becomes a defending card on the active chain link for its controller's hero[7.0.5]. A defense reaction card fails to resolve if it cannot become a defending card[5.3.2c].
Example: If an attack has dominate (can't be defended by more than 1 card from hand) and there are two defense reactions on the stack, the first one will resolve and become a defending card, but the second one will fail to resolve because dominate prevents it from becoming a defending card.
7.4.3 Second and finally, when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, the Reaction Step ends and the Damage Step begins.
7.5 Damage Step
7.5.1 The Damage Step is a game state where the physical damage of the active chain link is calculated and applied.
7.5.2 First, damage is calculated for the attack-target(s). If the power of the attack is greater than the sum total defense value of the defending cards for the attack-target, the attack deals {p} damage (physical damage) to the attack-target equal to the difference.
Example: If the power of the attack is 6, and there are two defending cards with a defense 3 and 2 respectively then the sum total defense value of the defending cards is 5. The power of the attack is greater than the sum total defense, so the attack-target is dealt 6-5=1 {p} damage.
7.5.2a Dealing {p} damage to the attack-target this way, is a hit-event generated by the game ([7.5.5]). The source of the damage is the attack.
7.5.2b If the attack-target has ceased to exist or is illegal when the damage is calculated, no damage is dealt, and the event is not generated.
7.5.2c If there are two or more attack-targets, damage is calculated and dealt separately for each attack-target in an order determined by the controller of the attack.
7.5.3 Second, the turn player gains priority.
7.5.4 Third and finally, when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, the Damage Step ends and the Resolution Step begins.
7.5.5 An attack is considered to have hit if it deals damage to an attack-target during the Damage Step of combat. The hit-event is otherwise identical to a deal {p} damage event[8.5.3] and only occurs during the Damage Step of combat.
7.5.5a If the attack-target loses life as a result of anything except damage dealt by the active-attack by the hit-event during the Damage Step of combat, then the attack is not considered to have hit.
7.5.5b If the hit-event is modified by replacement effects such that no damage is dealt by the active-attack to the attack-target, it is no longer a hit-event - the attack is not considered to have hit when the event occurs. Damage may still be dealt if the hit-event is modified, but it is not considered a hit-event if the active-attack is not the source of the damage that would be dealt to the attack-target.
Example: Feign Death has the text "The next time you would be dealt damage this turn, prevent it." If the effect from Feign Death prevents all damage dealt by the active-attack, no damage is dealt, the hit-event does not occur, and the attack is not considered to have hit.
7.5.5c If a rule or effect prevents a triggered effect from triggering when the active-attack hits and/or when it deals damage, then the triggered effect does not trigger on the hit-event.
Example: Stamp Authority has the text "Attack action card effects do not trigger when they hit," which prevents triggered effects from attack action card triggering on a hit-event. If a triggered effect from an attack action card would trigger on damage being dealt (e.g. Blizzard Bolt), and the attack action card hits, the effect will not trigger on the hit-event.
7.5.5d A chain link is considered to have hit if any hit-event occurs while it is the active chain link.
7.6 Resolution Step
7.6.1 The Resolution Step is a game state where the active chain link resolves and the attacker may gain an action point from go again and continue the combat chain by attacking.
7.6.2 First, the active chain link becomes a resolved chain link and effects that trigger when the chain link resolves are triggered. If the attack has go again, its controller gains 1 action point.
7.6.2a If the attack is no longer on the combat chain, the last known information of the attack is used to determine whether the attack has go again.
7.6.3 Second, the turn player gains priority. If an attack is added to the stack, the Resolution Step ends and the Layer Step begins.
7.6.3a The turn player may play or activate another attack during the Resolution Step, including attack action cards or abilities with attack.
7.6.4 Third and finally, when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, the Resolution Step ends and the Close Step begins.
7.7 Close Step
7.7.1 The Close Step is a game state where the combat chain closes and combat ends. Players do not get priority during the Close Step.
7.7.2 If a rule or effect causes the combat chain to close, the current step (if any) ends and the Close Step begins. The combat chain closes in the following situations:
7.7.2a If all players pass in succession when the stack is empty during the Resolution Step, the Close Step begins.[7.6.4]
7.7.2b If there are no valid attack-targets at the beginning of the Attack Step, the Close Step begins.[7.2.2]
7.7.2c If the active-attack of the active chain link does not exist or cannot move to the combat chain as a chain link[7.2.3d], or the active-attack ceases to exist before damage is calculated[7.5.2], the Close Step begins as a game state action.[1.10.2]
Example: Luminaris has the text "[...] Illusionist auras you control are weapons with 1{p} and "Once per Turn Action -- 0: Attack"." If a Spectral Shield token is activated to attack the opponent, and the token is destroyed before the Damage Step, the activated attack will also cease to exist, and the Close Step will begin.
7.7.2d If an effect closes the combat chain, the Close Step begins as a game state action.[1.10.2]
7.7.3 First, the "combat chain closes" event occurs and effects that trigger from the combat chain closing are triggered. All attacks and reactions on the stack, are put into their owner's graveyard.
7.7.4 Second, layers on the stack resolve and game state actions are performed as if all players are passing priority in succession.[1.10.2]
7.7.5 Third, when the stack is empty, all permanents remaining on the combat chain return to their respective zones - equipment and weapons return to their respective equipped zones. Any other permanent returns to the permanent zone.
7.7.6 Fourth, all remaining objects on the combat chain are cleared.[3.0.12]
7.7.7 Fifth and finally, the combat chain closes. Effects that last for "the/this combat chain" end. The Close Step ends and the Action Phase continues.

9 Additional Rules
9.0 General
9.1 Double-Faced Cards
9.1.1 A double-faced card is a card with two sets of properties - each set printed as a separate face on the card.
9.1.2 Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of printed properties.
9.1.2a If a player may look at a double-faced card, they may look at both faces of the card.
9.1.2b If an effect instructs a player to name a card[8.5.21], they may name one side of a double-faced card, but not both.
9.1.2c If an effect applies to a double-faced card, it continues to apply to the card even if its properties are defined by a different face, as long as it does not cease to exist between changing properties.
Example: Oasis Respite has the text "Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to target hero this turn by a source of your choice." If a flip-card card with its front-face active is chosen as the source, then the flip-card resolves, enters the arena, and its back-face becomes active, it is still subjected to Oasis Respite's effect.
9.1.3 A flip-card is a double-faced card that has a front-face and a back-face, with one of the following printed subtypes on its front-face: figment, invocation, or construct. Only one face of a flip-card is active at any given point. The properties of a flip-card are defined by its active face. The types of its front-face determines if it is a hero-, token-, deck-, or arena-card[1.3].
9.1.3a If a flip-card is outside the game, its front-face is active.
9.1.3b If a flip-card is inside the game, its front-face is active until a rule or effect would make its back-face active. If the card would then become a new card, its front-face is active again.[3.0.9]
Example: Construct Nitro Mechanoid is the front-face of a flip-card. When it resolves on the stack, its Construct subtype rules that it enters the arena with its back face active, turning it into Nitro Mechanoid. If it is destroyed and moves to the graveyard, it becomes a Construct Nitro Mechanoid again because its front-face is active.
9.1.4 A twin-card is a double-faced card that has two faces. One or both faces of a twin-card may be active at any given point. The properties of a twin-card are defined by its active face(s). The combination of the types of both its faces determines if it is a hero-, token-, deck-, or arena-card[1.3].
9.1.4a If a twin-card is outside the arena and not on the stack, both of its faces are active.
Example: Levia, Redeemed // Blasmophet, Levia Consumed is a twin-card with the text "Action -- Turn all cards in your banished zone face-down: Transform into Levia, Redeemed. Activate this ability only while this is in your inventory and you have 13 or more cards with blood debt in your banished zone." and "While this is in your inventory, when blood debt reduces your {h} to 13, you may transform into Blasmophet, Levia Consumed." respectively. While this card is in a player's inventory, both of these abilities are functional because the card as a whole has both sets of properties from both its faces.
9.1.4b If a twin-card is in the arena or on the stack, only one of its faces is active. Its active face is determined by the player that played it, or by the effect that put it into the arena or on the stack.
9.1.5 A transcend-card is a double-faced card that has a front-face and a back-face, with the front-face that has an ability that generates the transcend effect[8.5.48]. Only one face of a transcend-card is active at any given point. The properties of a transcend-card are defined by its active face. The types of its front-face determines if it is a deck- or arena-card[1.3].
9.1.5a If a transcend-card is outside the game, its front-face is active.
9.1.5b If a transcend-card is inside the game, its front-face is active until it transcends and makes its back-face active. Its back-face remains active even if it would become a new object.[3.0.9]
Example: Stir the Pot is the front-face of a transcend-card. When it resolves, and transcends, its Inner Chi back-face becomes the active face and it is put into its owner's hand. For the remainder of the game, it will continue to be Inner Chi, whether it is pitched, discarded, banished, etc.
9.2 Split-Cards
9.2.1 A split-card is a card with two names, typeboxes, and textboxes - each printed on different sides of the card.
9.2.2 A split-card is considered a single card with all the properties of both sides, except when put onto the stack[9.2.3].
Example: Comet Storm||Shock is a single card with two names ("Comet Storm" and "Shock"), two supertypes (Lightning and Wizard), two types (Instant and Action), and two sets of abilities.
9.2.2a A split-card can only be included in a player's card-pool if the supertypes of both sides are a subset of their hero's supertypes[1.1.3].
Example: A player can only include Comet Storm||Shock if their hero has the Lightning and Wizard supertypes.
9.2.2b If an effect instructs a player to name a card[8.5.21], they may name one of the two split-card names, but not both.
9.2.3 When a split-card is put onto the stack, the player that puts it there chooses one of its two sides[5.1.2c]. For the remainder of its existence, it is considered to have only the name, typebox, and textbox of the chosen side. The other side's name, typebox, and textbox are considered to not exist.
Example: Comet Storm||Shock is a split card. If the player chooses the left side, the card only has the name Comet Storm, the typebox "Wizard Action," and textbox "Deal 5 arcane damage to any target." If the player chooses the right side, the card only has the name Shock, the typebox "Lightning Instant," and textbox "Deal 1 arcane damage to any target."
9.3 Marked
9.3.1 Marked is a special condition that a hero may have.
9.3.2 A hero is marked if an effect causes them to be marked[8.5.50]
9.3.2a If an effect would cause a marked hero to become marked, they continue to be marked.
9.3.2b A marked hero continues to be marked until they are hit by a source controlled by an opponent or they cease to exist.
9.3.3 When a marked hero is hit by a source controlled by an opponent[7.5.5], the marked condition of that hero is removed as part of the hit event. The removal of the marked condition is not a game state-process or a triggered effect.
